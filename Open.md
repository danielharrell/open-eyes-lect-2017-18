My lecture tonight is in four parts.

# Part One {#one}

    - "I can't get the jar open."
    - "When does the store open?"
    - "The window is open."
    - "He's an open book." 
    - "She greeted them with open arms."
    - "My door is always open."
    - "Keep an open mind."
    - "Open your heart."
    - "My eyes were finally opened."

We use the word "open" in ways that range from the prosaic
to the profound. But why does the word have such scope? This
is one reason for wonder.

Another reason is that we use the word, typically,
without further ado, as if its meaning were already
understood. But if so, then how is it understood?
And is there something here not understood? Or better
understood? The difference between a door and an open door
may be like the difference between Socrates and Socrates
sitting. For only a philosopher, says Aristotle,
would care about this difference.[^Socrates] But the
philosopher in all of us, then, can wonder about that
difference. We can wonder what it means to say "my door is
always open"---even if asking this of a friend, who just
said it to you, risks being rude. Or dense. The way we use
the word "open" without further thought may make it worth
further thought.

Still another reason for wonder comes from the way we
define the word "open" in dictionaries---largely through
negation. To be open means *not* to be closed. Or blocked.
Or covered. Or fastened. Or sealed. Or buttoned. Or guarded.
Or protected. Or folded. Or clenched. Or concealed. Or
constipated.[^Dictionary] This may be definition enough for
everyday use. But what about those deeper moments of speech,
when we talk of eyes being opened? Or arms? Hearts? Minds?
Or again the proverbial door, always open to a friend?
Here we use the word "open" for a positive
condition, a state of being, which any negative definition
at best half-comprehends. And to ask about the meaning of
"open", then, is to ask about the meaning of hospitality,
generosity, enlightenment, love.

Nor are these the only such states of being. Think of how we
say our eyes are open, merely to mean we are awake. But why
say this of our eyes, and not our eyelids, which we might
call "open" more literally? To use the word for our eyes may
be figurative; but it captures how we seem to see *through*
our eyes, as if they were open, to
a whole world outside us. <!-- Could refer back to this when
I get to transparent cage in Wolff quote.-->  To ask about the
meaning of "open", then, is to ask about the meaning of
wakefulness, watchfulness, awareness. It is to ask about
a way of being that may well be *our* way of being: the one
underneath all the others; the one that explains *why* we
use the word with such scope, and as if it were already
understood.

Awareness might also explain our reliance on
negation to define the word. For in one sense,
a negative sense, being open in awareness means being
*not* ourselves, so far as we are aware of anything else.
<!--Later come back to this idea involving negation, where
we are transformed by awareness into a kind of invisibility.
THis relates to way in which world is *other* to us--> But
negation here seems especially half-comprehending.
For beneath our awareness of anything else is an
awareness we have of ourselves. <!-- Later connect this
point, perhaps, to Adam and Eve and nakedness: the price of
knowledge is the shame of nakedness.--> And this gives the
word "open" a deeper sense of positive scope, as it
comprehends self and other at once, and captures something
that our times of solitude and solicitude have in common.

In this vein, too, the word "open" might have a home in any
community that conceives itself as a community of learning,
and believes, without the blush of contradiction, that
learning best happens among others, yet only happens in
oneself. And if no one else can do your learning for you,
it might take a word like "open" to explain why you don't
find yourself alone at this college, but among others around
a table, face-to-face. To ask about the meaning of "open",
then, is to ask about the meaning of this. The meaning of
us. Just as we can ask, as we look at the cover of the St.
John's viewbook, why the word "open" might be enough to
introduce us. <!--Later refer back to this last sentence,
in trying to rehabilite positive question after arguing
againts its possibility. Something like: does this
impossibility mean that we are guilty of false advertising
on the cover of the St. John's viewbook?-->

[Back to top](#top)



# Part Two {#two}

In all these ways, the word "open" gives us much to wonder
about. But there is another way, I want to suggest, in which
the word gives us just one thing to wonder about. <!--Later
shift: the word gives us the only thing to wonder about. For
wonder depends on being open, and is perhaps the deepest
mark of its possibility.--> And this is by analogy,
borrowing from Aristotle again, to the one thing we can
wonder about when we encounter, as if for the first time,
figures made of wood come to life; or the sun reverse course
one day in the sky; or the diagonal of a square escape
measure by any part of its side, no matter how
small.[^AristotleWonder]. The wonder, in each case, is how
such a thing is possible. <!--Later point out that this
isn't really possible, on a certain philosophical
explanation--> Once we learn how, we can give what we
encounter a name, like "marionette", or "solstice", or
"incommensurable." But these can become words we inherit
rather than originate, to discourage
understanding just as much as display it, as we use the name
for what we don't yet know as if we do. <!--Later return to
this: Aristotle says we end in opposite state from wonder,
which suggests a kind of negation of world in which wonder
began, or an understanding of world that leaves no place for
wonder; just like Aristotle's account of nous. Another way
to describe this: how the cause of wonder ends up being
located in the realm of appearance, to be dispelled by an
account of the reality. Then can move on to Phaedo.-->
<!--Another thought: In moving from an appearance of
openness to its denial in reality, we are thinking
philosophically, yet common life continues to embrace
openness. Could use the Bergson quote here. Then quote from
other others to show the ambivalence of philosophy.-->

The word "open", I suspect, is just such a name. Behind it,
or beneath it, lies a problem, a paradox, to make us wonder
how being open is possible. <!--Later, in transition, point
out that we started perhaps in the attempt to explain how
openness is possible, only to argue that it isn't possible,
or that its an appearance rather than a reality. This is
what philosophical reflection does. (Don't forget Bergson
here.) --> But to wonder how is also unlikely, since we have
the word "open" to prove its possibility. 

## The Jar

If, for example, I say "I can't get the jar open", I will
look for a better grip on the lid, not the word. But even
here, I can wonder about the word. For why get a better grip
on the lid to open the jar? Suppose I decide not to bother
with the lid, and simply throw the jar to the ground,
breaking it open. Why is this not simply another way of
opening the jar? Why say instead that I *broke* the jar
open?

We say this, it seems, in wanting the jar to remain a jar:
something opened *without* being broken. More abstractly put:
we want the word "open" to mean that the barrier between
the jar's inside and outside has been removed, without the
difference between inside and outside being erased. Or still
more abstractly: we want the word "open" to mean that there
is continuity, yet at the same time discontinuity, between
inside and outside.

But here, then, is the paradox. For how can there be
continuity and discontinuity at once? In this case, how is
the jar's inside still inside, and not outside, as soon as
the lid is removed? If we leave the jar open, its contents
may spoil---as if for nature, even if not for us, a lidless
jar has no inside, and can only gain one by being closed.
In what sense, then, can I truly open the jar, no matter
how great my grip on the lid?

## The Parabola

This is one way to wonder how being open is possible. For
another way, from a different direction, consider a line
from geometry: the parabola. We can distinguish the sides of
this line, one convex and one concave, since the parabola is
curved. But suppose we go further, and take the convex side
to be inside the parabola, and the concave side to be
outside. This would treat the curved line as a figure,
analogous to the ellipse, only open rather than closed. We
might even liken this figure to an lidless, empty jar. But
what would justify this interpretation? Why think that the
parabola *has* an inside, distinct from, but open to, an
outside? Why aren't both sides of the parabola outside it,
since both lie outside the line of the parabola?

To answer this question, and in defense of the
interpretation, we could make the inside of the parabola
definite, by completing the analogy to the ellipse. We would
then take the parabola to be an infinite ellipse, with one
focus infinitely far away. The parabolic line would then be
infinite in length, with ends that reach the edge, as it
were, of the geometric plane. But in that case, it seems,
our parabola will gain a true inside in just the way our jar
possessed one: by being closed. For there will be no way
into the parabola, or out of it, through its open end, since
this now lies infinitely far away. Or to put the paradox
more sharply: once we make the line of the parabola
infinite, to make the inside of the parabola definite, we
will have *enclosed* the parabola in openness. And by being
enclosed, the openness of the parabola is made at once
intelligible yet impassable. Its open end will be something
we can plainly see, even point to, yet never reach---as if
openness had no being but seeming.

<!--Note later that we wonder this by giving arguments for
its impossibility; and philosophy rests here, in
impossibility. In mere appearance, then go back to examples
from Aristotle, then Bergson.--> The parabola, then, gives us
another way to wonder how being open is possible. And while
it might seem contrived, in coming from mathematics, it
suggests a more general way, and radical way, to wonder how
being open is possible. For what if every way of being open
were like the parabola? That is, what if every way of being
open were really a way of being closed that merely looked
open? What if we ourselves were enclosed in openness? 

## Awareness

This last question invites us to take a second look at
awareness. For awareness, again, might be the openness most
our own, comprehending self and other at once. But how? How
can I ever *be* self and other at once? Or to put the
paradox in spatial terms: how can I be inside myself and
outside myself at once?  

To resolve the paradox, we might suppose I am not
really outside myself in my awareness of anything
else. <!--Perhaps later refer back to this paradox, and
resolve it the other way.--> Here at the podium, for
example, I am aware of you---all of you---in the audience,
perhaps to the point of anxiety. But it can seem absurd to
think my awareness of you carries me into the audience. And
the anxiety in this awareness suggests it is not just in
body, but also in mind, that I stay right here, at the
podium, all alone. <!-- Later perhaps you can revert back to
this anxiety, to address issue of dislocation.--> To be
aware of you, in that case, is not to become you, or even to
reach you, but instead---so we might say---to *encompass*
you. Or as we do sometimes say: to *include* you in my point
of view. I would be at the podium, then, as if I were at the
center of a circumference that you in the audience were
inside rather than outside. And this is why I would not be
carried outside myself in my awareness of anything else. 
For instead, this awareness would bring the outside inside, and
make it mine where I stand, at the point of my point of
view. And the self, more generally, would not be
transcended, but expanded, in the awareness of anything
else, allowing self-awareness to contain it, not contradict
it. 

But if the self is *not* transcended in the awareness of
anything else, then it is hard to see how we are truly open
rather than truly closed. For on this account of awareness,
it seems that only if the self *encloses* what lies outside
it, can the self be *open* to what lies outside it. And we
ourselves would then be enclosed in openness, just like the
parabola, in having selves at all, and as if being open were
how being closed looked from within.


# Part Three {#three}

The self, then, gives us a final way to wonder how being
open is possible. So *is* it possible? And if it is, then
how? Or should we take arguments against its possibility
to be not just provocative, but persuasive? Should these
arguments deepen our wonder? Or dispel it? 

I just gave three such arguments, drawn from a jar,
a parabola, and the self. But I now want to turn to
a fourth, drawn from a book read in seminar, to clarify a 
limit, I think, in arguments against openness. So consider
this passage, from perhaps the greatest novel written in
English: <!--later mention how openness a matter of
description, not argument-->

> We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world
as an udder to feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early
begun to emerge from that stupidity, but yet it had been
easier to her to imagine how she would devote herself to Mr.
Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his strength and
wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is no
longer reflection but feeling---an idea wrought back to the
directness of sense, like the solidity of objects--that he
had an equivalent centre of self, whence the lights and
shadows must always fall with a certain difference.[^MMDorothea]

Readers of *Middlemarch* may remember this passage, and the
unhappy marriage that prompts it, between Dorothea Brooke
and Edward Causabon. Leaving context aside, we can read the
passage as an argument against openness, despite how it
begins, against the closedness of moral stupidity. For it is
in her emergence from this stupidity, along with her desire,
in devotion, to transcend herself in life, that Dorothea
suffers a kind of blindness towards her husband, deeper than
any delusions of his greatness. To see him truly, then, is
*not* to see him as a lesser man, without the strength or
wisdom to make her wise and strong in turn. It is rather to
see him as another self, which makes her a self in turn, no
matter how selfless she yearns to be. 

The passage thus suggests something false in self-transcendence,
even if it were possible. For it can blind one to the
selfhood in others that we might say makes for true
transcendence in recognition, not renunciation. And an
openness of recognition, then, is an openness still enclosed
in selfhood. 

But now suppose we were ready to accept this argument
against openness. What should we make, then, of this later
passage in *Middlemarch*:

> For my part I am very sorry for him. It is an uneasy lot
at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to
enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and
never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering
self—never to be fully possessed by the glory we behold,
never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into
the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the
energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and
uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and
dim-sighted.[^MMCausabon]

The subject of this passage, of course, is Causabon himself.
And Eliot addresses the reader directly, I think, to
persuade us, if not to love him, at least to acknowledge
him, and come to know him, then, in his selfhood, just as
Dorothea must learn to do. Yet to know Causabon in his selfhood,
on Eliot's account, is to pity him for a self he can never
escape. Eliot writes as if there were no way to enjoy, and
still be enclosed. For what selfhood is left once we are
possessed, fully, by the glory we behold? Or once our
consciousness is transformed, rapturously, into the
vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the energy
of an action? Eliot describes enjoyment as if it were an
experience not of satisfaction, but of consummation.
A liberation from the self in need, intelligibly enough; but
where what remains in deliverance, more puzzlingly, is *not*
the self fulfilled, or even a self at all, but only the
fulfillment itself, with nothing left to fill. 

The puzzle here is again the puzzle of self-transcendence,
or the paradox of an openness *not* enclosed. 
Yet Eliot describes this as if it were patent rather than
puzzling. She writes of enjoyment, in other words, not to
make *it* look exceptional, but to make a man without it
look exceptional. And if we are to pity him, and acknowledge
him, through pity, in his selfhood, then it seems we must
take the self-transcendence he has never known to be
a matter of fact, not a matter for doubt. Yet how can it be
taken this way, unless it *is*, somehow, a matter of fact? 

This passage thus suggests that the limit in arguments
against openness is that they are arguments, then, against
a fact. They suppose that something present, perhaps even
ever-present, might not be possible, and then crown this
mistake by deeming it impossible. Or to speak more
generously of such arguments, if indeed they are arguments
against a fact: our wonder at the word "open" should not be
dispelled by them, but deepened. And one way to acknowledge
this, I think, is to recast our question in wonder. For what
if this question, now, were *not*: how is being open
possible? But rather: how is being open present?

# Part Four {#four}

To clarify what this change of question might mean,
consider the following passage, from a book of philosophy
by Henri Bergson:

> It would greatly astonish a man unaware of the speculations
of philosophy if we told him that the object before him,
which he sees and touches, exists only in his mind and for
his mind or even, more generally, exists only for mind, as
Berkeley held. Such a man would always maintain that the
object exists independently of the consciousness which
perceives it. But, on the other hand, we should astonish him
quite as much by telling him that the object is entirely
different from that which is perceived in it, that it has
neither the color ascribed to it by the eye nor the
resistance found in it by the hand. The color, the
resistance, are, for him, in the object: they are not states
of our mind; they are part and parcel of an existence really
independent of our own. For common sense, then, the object
exists in itself, and, on the other hand, the object is, in
itself, pictorial, as we perceive it: image it is, but
a self-existing image.[^Bergson]

We can read this passage, I think, as an account of how
being open is not just possible, but present, in what
Bergson calls common sense. Because of it, the way things
seem is the way things are, in one mark of openness; and
arguments to the contrary sound incredible, in another mark.
Or to sound less simplistic about this, we could say that
for common sense, any difference between seeming and being
can be resolved, as I catch myself, and correct myself, when
I mistake one thing for another. It therefore takes an act
of thought *beyond* common sense to make the difference
between seeming and being *irresolvable*. We need Plato's
allegory of the cave, or Descartes' *malin génie*, or some
like appeal to a postulate rather than a phenomenon, to
persuade us that the way things seem is *not* the way they
are. And even then, because the appeal is to a postulate,
the way we experience the world through common sense is left
untouched. (Mention seminar here, and find a way to incorporate
Euclidean.) 

, to tell us persuade us that we may never see
things as they are, And the most famous examples of acts of
thought in this sense---Plato's allegory of the cave;
Descartes' his is why our most famous examples of , in this
sense, therefore requires an act of thought beyond common
sense, bounds, ,   

- So it requires acts of thought, positing
things that cannot be seen, to make sense of the difference
between being and seeming in general.

- Example of how we are left untouched, even if persuaded:
seminar.

- Lobachevski another act of thought.

Bergson's account can also remind us that the
deepest arguments against our openness in this sense---which
is to say, the deepest arguments that the way things seem is
*not* the way they are---require acts of philosophical
thought that are uncommon, even heroic. It takes the likes
of Plato's allegory of the cave, or Descartes' *malin
génie*, to establish the difference between being and
seeming in general, since this difference in particular is an
everyday experience of common sense, in mistakes of
perception that we can catch, and correct, as if to
punctuate our openness before a word of philosophical
speculation might tempt us, instead, to cross it out. 
And there is also a way that philosophical speculation
can persuade us on the outside while leaving us untouched
on the inside. can leave our *experience* of Bergson's account might be extended even to our
deepest moments of thought. 



what might be called

uncommon acts, even heroic acts, of thought: And together, these are marks of  

If we were truly open, how things seem would be how things
are. But this is how they are for common sense, where
the object at once exists in itself and is *as* we perceive
it. 

FHow is being open present: 
    - For common sense, how things seem is how things are.
    - Common sense is immune to philosophical reflection. 
    - Philosophical reflection, how things seem is *not* how
    things are. It is predicated on the difference between
    seeming and being. 

- Also mention from quote that philosophical reflection can
be identified with being enclosed: cannot get "outside"
oneself. This is perhaps the most compelling argument against
being open: that if we were open, how things seem would be
how things are. But philosophy predicated on diference
between seeming and being. 
- Perhaps mention Descartes in this context: to separate
seeming from being requires more than an appeal to the
deceptions in perception, for these are local, not
global, and self-correcting. You need a more general
comparison involving all of wakeful life, either in
dreaming, or in a deceptive being outside me. Also
compare to Plato. Platonic cave. A prisoner "unchained",
but how? By whom? needs malicious
  demon to really get seeming separated from being.
No continuity between seeming and being; need break.

To clarify what I mean, consider this
passage, from a book by Bergson:  

- Comment on this passage: if being open were possible,
this is how it would be. But in this passage, openness
is not possible, but present. And the way it is present
is by being immune to philosophy.

<!--Perhaps obvious that from the inside the inside cannot
be told, like being in a cave. But how do we get from
inside to outside to tell it. Strengthen sense in which
the inside seems sufficient. And what distinguishes
the outside in which we are always outside ourselves,
from the outside in which we are always inside ourselves?
Also, in below, perhaps make explicit the inference
from awareness to being outside ourselves more generally.
-->

What Bergson attributes here to common sense, we can take to
be what awareness is like from inside it. And from the
inside, awareness is nothing but openness. The way things
seem is the way things are, as if we saw them from *no*
point of view, and were outside ourselves as a matter of
course. And to suspect otherwise; to think we are never
outside ourselves wholly; to suppose we always see things
from a point of view; to doubt that the way things seem is
ever the way things are---this is what awareness is like
from outside it, or from what Bergson attributes here to the
speculations of philosophy. From the outside, then,
awareness is always enclosed in openness. And if our
selfhood is what encloses it, then we have a way to sharpen
our paradox to a kind of point: for we could say it is only
from outside ourselves that we can see ourselves enclosed;
only from outside ourselves that we come to see the self we
are always inside of; the self that makes being outside
ourselves questionable, and even impossible: a contradiction
in terms. But if it *is* a contradiction in terms, then how
did we get outside ourselves to see it, and why is that not
enough to contradict the contradiction? 

<!--Note, this stretch should be connected to previous
part, in that we are not open to self and other at once.-->

In other words, what distinguishes the outside within, where
we are always outside ourselves, and nothing but openness,
from the outside without, where we are always inside
ourselves, and enclosed in openness? And how are we ever
carried from the one outside to the other? (Note: should
make this the true sense of openness.) If the way things
seem is the way things are, from within awareness, then how
do we ever escape awareness, as if from a cave, to see, with
self-awareness, that the way things seem is *not* the way
they are? If common-sense, as Bergson describes this, is
adequate enough to make astonishing the speculations of
philosophy against that adequacy, then how do these
speculations ever arise, much less become convincing? What
makes philosophy possible? What makes wonder possible? What
makes openness possible? 

# Leftovers

- Point: there is already enough transcendence inside
  awareness to make us wonder how we ever get outside it. 
- Philosphical reflection is superfluous.
- Then mention perspective in relation to Lobachevski.
    - It can seem as easy to separate seeming from being by
      noting that parallel tracks don't "look" parallel.
    - But in fact they do look parallel. The convergence,
    in this case, belongs to their increasing distance from
    us, not to their.  
    - Sameness of proportion is sameness of being. Difference
    in size sameness of being.

- How things seem is how things are: sameness of proportion is a
sameness of identity, and allows us to see (objects appear at
various distances.)

Problem of consciousness: no continuity between world of perception
and world of embodiment. Gap in explanation. Gap between what it
is and what it is like. Dislocation.

Freud: deepening of self; but alternative, the conceiving of
a self.

Use Euclid vs Lobachevski as difference between infinity that preserves appearance vs finitude that undermines it. 
- Music: The sounds of instruments in an orchestra become
  a world of tones unto itself, with movements justified by
  consonance and dissonance. 
    - Making the way things seem the way they are: the art
      of music. Making them seem all the more the way they
      are, in movements justified by dissonance, and
      consonance. But from outside this world, it can be
      reduced to the look of a student in headphones,
      utterly withdrawn from the way things are.
- The problem here is really a Platonic one.
    - Mention how it can be too easy to suppose we really
      live in a cave. 
    - Seminar: we take to be opinions, or perspectives, but
      really not.
    - Seminar: there is something on the table, not just in
      the chairs.
    - Seminar: From outside seminar it may seem we merely
      express points of view; but from inside seminar, to
      hear what you say this way would be to miss your
      point, or even dismiss your point. What you said takes
      precedence over why you said it, just as why you said
      it in terms of reasons, takes precedence over why you
      said it in terms of symptoms. For the point you try to
      make, is not the point from which you make it, but at
      the other end, infinitely far away. Words are not
      simply signs of something, but symbols for something
      else. They are about something, even if also from
      something. 
      
Other related lecture thoughts: 
- Does world in which I am embodied precede or follow world
  in which I am intelligent? 
- Sign: my sense of disorientation in not knowing why I am
  here. Why I exist
- Music not a perspective: tones separated from instruments,
  made a world onto itself, where how things look, or sound,
  us how they are. 
- Use of language: to listen to me as if I were expressing
  a perspective, rooted in myself, is a way missing or
  dismissing my point, rather than understanding it.
  (Despite our calling conversations a sharing of
  perspective). This shows how language is about something,
  not from something. 
- Point of view in music negated or made absolute: since
  every point is now. In time. 
- Point of view in perspective is not where I am, but the
  limit of what I see: vanishing point. q
- Does world in which I am embodied precede or follow world
  in which I am intelligent? 
- Sign: my sense of disorientation in not knowing why I am
  here. Why I exist
- Music outside in space, as if we were on the outside.
- Music not a perspective: tones separated from instruments,
  made a world onto itself, where how things look, or sound,
  us how they are. A world unto itself without a point of
  view, or at best, an absolute one, in the now of time. One
  tone a point of view? But organizes the tonal world around
  it. My own center is *the* center. The way things seem (in
  sound) is the way things are.

  a perspective, rooted in myself, is a way missing or

- Point of view in music negated or made absolute: since

- Point of view in perspective is not where I am, but the
  limit of what I see: vanishing point.
- Another thought: point of view suggests that line radiate
  from it. But in perspective, lines converge on points, at
  at infinite distance (if Euclidian), making the point of
  view, measured back from that distance of convergence,
  infinite in size, as if I were everywhere rather than
  somewhere. 
- Language for thought as perspectiveless in being about
  something. 
- Point of view most familiar to us from perception, say of
  vision. 
- Aristotle: invisibility of self (presence of soul)
    - Invisibility not contained in circle; no point
    - Nakedness and anxiety also evidence of this
    - Aristotle’s account of awareness in soul not self has
      this evidence for it: we are not a part of what we
      see, and can only reintroduce ourselves into what we
      see bodily. 
    - Note: center of circle still within circle. (Not
      invisible as in Aristotle account.)
    - anxiety at podium revisited
    - sense of thrownness
    - Aristotle writes about the soul, not the self. 
    - Self is found before it is founded
    - seminar: What we bring to the table is one thing; what
      happens at the table, in front of everyone, is another
      thing. 
    - Seminar: To listen as if I had a point of view is not
      to appreciate my point, but to dismiss. This point
      like the point of perspective. Point I am trying to
      make is not the point of which I make it. Point I am
      trying to make not meant to reflect my point of view
      but transcend it. 
    - sight that doesn't include me means it is an
      appearance behind which lies a reality. 
- Things become what they sound like: being as location.
  Harmony. Contrast to dislocation. Music expression of
  outwardbess, not inwardbess
- Lecture: nakedness not a need to be covered, but to be
  placed. Not a matter of inside and outside but of place.
  Music is calming in this way. 
- anxiety might mean you have a deep self, but it could mean
  you have no self. Problem of having no self. 
- Nakedness and dislocation: not having clothes, not having
  a home. Dislocation of awareness, finding, not having,
  a point of view, a place to stand. Link to education in
  the end Nakedness and dislocation: not having clothes, not
  having a home. Dislocation of awareness, finding, not
  having, a point of view, a place to stand. Link to
  education in the end 
- Three things to recommend Aristotle: invisibility,
  anxiety, soul rather than self
- Also: invisibility of self is really visibility, outside
  self, and dislocation with respect to self.
- Lobachevski: mathematical image of things not being as
  they seem, but predicated on uncertainty 
- Idea of self from looking at the self from outside it,
  self refuting. Or more generously, self is our way of
  locating ourselves inside the self. We are not enclosed
  but enclothed. Only outside the self that we can look
  enclosed by the self. So it is the case that we are open,
  but look closed.  
- Return to wonder by end: Science leaves no place for us to
  find in the world Wonder is about one's place in the
  world.
    - Can being sent into world be linked to wonder?
    - Diagonal alongside the square. (No hiddeness in
      world.)
    - Cause of wonder not behind what we see, but beside
      what we see. 
    - Idea: wonder not suspicion. Wonder linked to
      disorientation, of being sent into the world.
      Explanation is a way to justify what we see, not to
      undermine what we see (as science does). Science takes
      our embodiment to be a given to be explained, by
      mechanical causality. Philosophy takes our embodiment
      to be achievement, to be justified by final causality.
    - Thales water: reality behind appearance not
      theological or scientific. Water has to remain water. 
     - Self refuting nature of self
     - Self a way to locate us
     - Wonder only possible in soul

[^Socrates]: "...it is the function of the philosopher to be able
to investigate all things. For if it is not the function of
the philosopher, who is it who will inquire whether Socrates
and Socrates seated are the same thing, or whether one thing
has one contrary, or what contrariety is, or how many
meanings it has? And similarly with all other such
questions." (Book IV, Part 2, *Metaphysics*)
