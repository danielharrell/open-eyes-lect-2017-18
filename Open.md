# Part One {#one}

    - "I can't get the jar open."
    - "When does the store open?"
    - "The window is open."
    - "He's an open book." 
    - "She greeted them with open arms."
    - "My door is always open."
    - "Keep an open mind."
    - "Open your heart."
    - "My eyes were finally opened."

We use the word "open" in ways that range from the prosaic
to the profound. But why does the word have such scope? This
is one reason for wonder.

Another reason is that we use the word, typically,
without further ado, as if its meaning were already
understood. But if so, then how is it understood?
And is there something here not understood? Or better
understood? The difference between a door and an open door
may be like the difference between Socrates and Socrates
sitting. For only a philosopher, says Aristotle,
would care about this difference.[^Socrates] But the
philosopher in all of us, then, can wonder about that
difference. We can wonder what it means to say "my door is
always open"---even if asking this of a friend, who just
said it to you, risks being rude. Or dense. The way we use
the word "open" without further thought may make it worth
further thought.

Still another reason for wonder comes from the way we
define the word "open" in dictionaries---largely through
negation. To be open means *not* to be closed. Or blocked.
Or covered. Or fastened. Or sealed. Or buttoned. Or guarded.
Or protected. Or folded. Or clenched. Or concealed. Or
constipated.[^Dictionary] This may be definition enough for
everyday use. But what about those deeper moments of speech,
when we talk of eyes being opened? Or arms? Hearts? Minds?
Or again the proverbial door, always open to a friend?
Here we use the word "open" for a positive
condition, a state of being, which any negative definition
at best half-comprehends. And to ask about the meaning of
"open", then, is to ask about the meaning of hospitality,
generosity, enlightenment, love.

Nor are these the only such states of being. Think of how we
say our eyes are open, merely to mean we are awake. But why
say this of our eyes, and not our eyelids, which we might
call "open" more literally? To use the word for our eyes may
be figurative; but it captures how we seem to see *through*
our eyes, as if they were open, to
a whole world outside us. <!-- Could refer back to this when
I get to transparent cage in Wolff quote.-->  To ask about the
meaning of "open", then, is to ask about the meaning of
wakefulness, watchfulness, awareness. It is to ask about
a way of being that may well be *our* way of being: the one
underneath all the others; the one that explains *why* we
use the word with such scope, and as if it were already
understood.

Awareness might also explain our reliance on
negation to define the word. For in one sense,
a negative sense, being open in awareness means being
*not* ourselves, so far as we are aware of anything else.
<!--Later come back to this idea involving negation, where
we are transformed by awareness into a kind of invisibility.
THis relates to way in which world is *other* to us--> But
negation here seems especially half-comprehending.
For beneath our awareness of anything else is an
awareness we have of ourselves. <!-- Later connect this
point, perhaps, to Adam and Eve and nakedness: the price of
knowledge is the shame of nakedness.--> And this gives the
word "open" a deeper sense of positive scope, as it
comprehends self and other at once, and captures something
that our times of solitude and solicitude have in common.

In this vein, too, the word "open" might have a home in any
community that conceives itself as a community of learning,
and believes, without the blush of contradiction, that
learning best happens among others, yet only happens in
oneself. And if no one else can do your learning for you,
it might take a word like "open" to explain why you don't
find yourself alone at this college, but among others around
a table, face-to-face. To ask about the meaning of "open",
then, is to ask about the meaning of this. The meaning of
us. Just as we can ask, as we look at the cover of the St.
John's viewbook, why the word "open" might be enough to
introduce us. <!--Later refer back to this last sentence,
in trying to rehabilite positive question after arguing
againts its possibility. Something like: does this
impossibility mean that we are guilty of false advertising
on the cover of the St. John's viewbook?-->

# Part Two {#two}

In all these ways, the word "open" gives us much to wonder
about. But there is another way, I want to suggest, in which
the word gives us just one thing to wonder about. <!--Later
shift: the word gives us the only thing to wonder about. For
wonder depends on being open, and is perhaps the deepest
mark of its possibility.--> And this is by analogy,
borrowing from Aristotle again, to the one thing we can
wonder about when we encounter, as if for the first time,
figures made of wood come to life; or the sun reverse course
one day in the sky; or the diagonal of a square escape
measure by any part of its side, no matter how
small.[^AristotleWonder]. The wonder, in each case, is how
such a thing is possible. <!--Later point out that this
isn't really possible, on a certain philosophical
explanation--> Once we learn how, we can give what we
encounter a name, like "marionette", or "solstice", or
"incommensurable." But these can become words we inherit
rather than originate, to discourage
understanding just as much as display it, as we use the name
for what we don't yet know as if we do. <!--Later return to
this: Aristotle says we end in opposite state from wonder,
which suggests a kind of negation of world in which wonder
began, or an understanding of world that leaves no place for
wonder; just like Aristotle's account of nous. Another way
to describe this: how the cause of wonder ends up being
located in the realm of appearance, to be dispelled by an
account of the reality. Then can move on to Phaedo.-->
<!--Another thought: In moving from an appearance of
openness to its denial in reality, we are thinking
philosophically, yet common life continues to embrace
openness. Could use the Bergson quote here. Then quote from
other others to show the ambivalence of philosophy.-->

The word "open", I suspect, is just such a name. Behind it,
or beneath it, lies a problem, a paradox, to make us wonder
how being open is possible. <!--Later, in transition, point
out that we started perhaps in the attempt to explain how
openness is possible, only to argue that it isn't possible,
or that its an appearance rather than a reality. This is
what philosophical reflection does. (Don't forget Bergson
here.) --> But to wonder how is also unlikely, since we have
the word "open" to prove its possibility. 

## The Jar

If, for example, I say "I can't get the jar open", I will
look for a better grip on the lid, not the word. But even
here, I can wonder about the word. For why get a better grip
on the lid to open the jar? Suppose I decide not to bother
with the lid, and simply throw the jar to the ground,
breaking it open. Why is this not simply another way of
opening the jar? Why say instead that I *broke* the jar
open?

We say this, it seems, in wanting the jar to remain a jar:
something opened *without* being broken. More abstractly put:
we want the word "open" to mean that the barrier between
the jar's inside and outside has been removed, without the
difference between inside and outside being erased. Or still
more abstractly: we want the word "open" to mean that there
is continuity, yet at the same time discontinuity, between
inside and outside.

But here, then, is the paradox. For how can there be
continuity and discontinuity at once? In this case, how is
the jar's inside still inside, and not outside, as soon as
the lid is removed? If we leave the jar open, its contents
may spoil---as if for nature, even if not for us, a lidless
jar has no inside, and can only gain one by being closed.
In what sense, then, can I truly open the jar, no matter
how great my grip on the lid?

## The Parabola

This is one way to wonder how being open is possible. For
another way, from a different direction, consider a line
from geometry: the parabola. We can distinguish the sides of
this line, one convex and one concave, since the parabola is
curved. But suppose we go further, and take the convex side
to be inside the parabola, and the concave side to be
outside. This would treat the curved line as a figure,
analogous to the ellipse, only open rather than closed. We
might even liken this figure to an lidless, empty jar. But
what would justify this interpretation? Why think that the
parabola *has* an inside, distinct from, but open to, an
outside? Why aren't both sides of the parabola outside it,
since both lie outside the line of the parabola?

To answer this question, and in defense of the
interpretation, we could make the inside of the parabola
definite, by completing the analogy to the ellipse. We would
then take the parabola to be an infinite ellipse, with one
focus infinitely far away. The parabolic line would then be
infinite in length, with ends that reach the edge, as it
were, of the geometric plane. But in that case, it seems,
our parabola will gain a true inside in just the way our jar
possessed one: by being closed. For there will be no way
into the parabola, or out of it, through its open end, since
this now lies infinitely far away. Or to put the paradox
more sharply: once we make the line of the parabola
infinite, to make the inside of the parabola definite, we
will have *enclosed* the parabola in openness. And by being
enclosed, the openness of the parabola is made at once
intelligible yet impassable. Its open end will be something
we can plainly see, even point to, yet never reach---as if
openness had no being but seeming.

<!--Note later that we wonder this by giving arguments for
its impossibility; and philosophy rests here, in
impossibility. In mere appearance, then go back to examples
from Aristotle, then Bergson.--> The parabola, then, gives us
another way to wonder how being open is possible. And while
it might seem contrived, in coming from mathematics, it
suggests a more general way, and radical way, to wonder how
being open is possible. For what if every way of being open
were like the parabola? That is, what if every way of being
open were really a way of being closed that merely looked
open? What if we ourselves were enclosed in openness? 

## Awareness

This last question invites us to take a second look at
awareness. For awareness, again, might be the openness most
our own, comprehending self and other at once. But how? How
can I ever *be* self and other at once? Or to put the
paradox in spatial terms: how can I be inside myself and
outside myself at once?  

To resolve the paradox, we might suppose I am not
really outside myself in my awareness of anything
else. <!--Perhaps later refer back to this paradox, and
resolve it the other way.--> Here at the podium, for
example, I am aware of you---all of you---in the audience,
perhaps to the point of anxiety. But it can seem absurd to
think my awareness of you carries me into the audience. And
the anxiety in this awareness suggests it is not just in
body, but also in mind, that I stay right here, at the
podium, all alone. <!-- Later perhaps you can revert back to
this anxiety, to address issue of dislocation.--> To be
aware of you, in that case, is not to become you, or even to
reach you, but instead---so we might say---to *encompass*
you. Or as we do sometimes say: to *include* you in my point
of view. I would be at the podium, then, as if I were at the
center of a circumference that you in the audience were
inside rather than outside. And this is why I would not be
carried outside myself in my awareness of anything else. 
For instead, this awareness would bring the outside inside, and
make it mine where I stand, at the point of my point of
view. And the self, more generally, would not be
transcended, but expanded, in the awareness of anything
else, allowing self-awareness to contain it, not contradict
it. 

But if the self is *not* transcended in the awareness of
anything else, then it is hard to see how we are truly open
rather than truly closed. For on this account of awareness,
it seems that only if the self *encloses* what lies outside
it, can the self be *open* to what lies outside it. And we
ourselves would then be enclosed in openness, just like the
parabola, in having selves at all, and as if being open were
how being closed looked from within.


# Part Three {#three}

The self, then, gives us a final way to wonder how being
open is possible. So *is* it possible? And if it is, then
how? Or should we take arguments against its possibility
to be not just provocative, but persuasive? Should these
arguments deepen our wonder? Or dispel it? 

I just gave three such arguments, drawn from a jar,
a parabola, and the self. But I now want to turn to
a fourth, drawn from a book read in seminar, to clarify a 
limit, I think, in arguments against openness. So consider
this passage, from perhaps the greatest novel written in
English: <!--later mention how openness a matter of
description, not argument-->

> We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world
as an udder to feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early
begun to emerge from that stupidity, but yet it had been
easier to her to imagine how she would devote herself to Mr.
Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his strength and
wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is no
longer reflection but feeling---an idea wrought back to the
directness of sense, like the solidity of objects--that he
had an equivalent centre of self, whence the lights and
shadows must always fall with a certain difference.[^MMDorothea]

Readers of *Middlemarch* may remember this passage, and the
unhappy marriage that prompts it, between Dorothea Brooke
and Edward Causabon. Leaving context aside, we can read the
passage as an argument against openness, despite how it
begins, against the closedness of moral stupidity. For it is
in her emergence from this stupidity, along with her desire,
in devotion, to transcend herself, that Dorothea
suffers a kind of blindness towards her husband, deeper than
any delusions of his greatness. To see him truly, then, is
*not* to see him as a lesser man, without the strength or
wisdom to make her wise and strong in turn. It is rather to
see him as another self, which makes her a self in turn, no
matter how selfless she yearns to be. 

The passage thus suggests something false in self-transcendence,
even if it were possible. For it can blind one to the
selfhood in others that we might say makes for true
transcendence in recognition, not renunciation. And an
openness of recognition, then, is an openness still enclosed
in selfhood. 

But now suppose we were ready to accept this argument
against openness. What should we make, then, of this later
passage in *Middlemarch*:

> For my part I am very sorry for him. It is an uneasy lot
at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to
enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and
never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering
self—never to be fully possessed by the glory we behold,
never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into
the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the
energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and
uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and
dim-sighted.[^MMCausabon]

The subject of this passage, of course, is Causabon himself.
And Eliot addresses the reader directly, I think, to
persuade us, if not to love him, at least to acknowledge
him, and come to know him, then, in his selfhood, just as
Dorothea must learn to do. Yet to know Causabon in his selfhood,
on Eliot's account, is to pity him for a self he can never
escape. Eliot writes as if there were no way to enjoy, and
still be enclosed. For what selfhood is left once we are
possessed, fully, by the glory we behold? Or once our
consciousness is transformed, rapturously, into the
vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the energy
of an action? Eliot describes enjoyment as if it were an
experience not of satisfaction, but of consummation.
A liberation from the self in need, intelligibly enough; but
where what remains in deliverance, more puzzlingly, is *not*
the self fulfilled, or even a self at all, but only the
fulfillment itself, with nothing left to fill. 

The puzzle here is again the puzzle of self-transcendence,
or the paradox of an openness *not* enclosed. 
Yet Eliot describes this as if it were patent rather than
puzzling. She writes of enjoyment, in other words, not to
make *it* look exceptional, but to make a man without it
look exceptional. And if we are to pity him, and acknowledge
him, through pity, in his selfhood, then it seems we must
take the self-transcendence he has never known to be
a matter of fact, not a matter for doubt. Yet how can it be
taken this way, unless it *is*, somehow, a matter of fact? 

This passage thus suggests that the limit in arguments
against openness is that they are arguments, finally, against
a fact. They suppose that something present, perhaps even
ever-present, might not be possible, and then crown this
mistake by deeming it impossible. Or to speak more
generously of such arguments, if they are arguments, indeed,
against a fact: our wonder at the word "open" should not be
dispelled by them, but deepened. And one way to acknowledge
this, I think, is to recast our question in wonder. For what
if this question, now, were *not*: how is being open
possible? But rather: how is being open present?

# Part Four {#four}

To clarify what this change of question might mean, consider
the following passage, from a book of philosophy by Henri
Bergson:

> It would greatly astonish a man unaware of the speculations
of philosophy if we told him that the object before him,
which he sees and touches, exists only in his mind and for
his mind or even, more generally, exists only for mind, as
Berkeley held. Such a man would always maintain that the
object exists independently of the consciousness which
perceives it. But, on the other hand, we should astonish him
quite as much by telling him that the object is entirely
different from that which is perceived in it, that it has
neither the color ascribed to it by the eye nor the
resistance found in it by the hand. The color, the
resistance, are, for him, in the object: they are not states
of our mind; they are part and parcel of an existence really
independent of our own. For common sense, then, the object
exists in itself, and, on the other hand, the object is, in
itself, pictorial, as we perceive it: image it is, but
a self-existing image.[^Bergson]

We can read this passage, I think, as an account of how
being open is present, in what Bergson calls common sense.
For there is nothing in common sense on this account, not
even the self, to enclose our openness to the world, and
separate the way things seem from the way things are.
Instead, the way things seem *is* the way things are, and
claims to the contrary sound incredible. We
are open to the world, without being enclosed, as a matter
of course.

But even this reading of the passage falls short, I think,
of what it suggests about the presence of openness. For
there is nothing in Bergson's account to indicate that
common sense is left untouched by the speculations of
philosophy because they are wrong. It is more as if they
have no power, wrong or right, to inform common sense. And
what this suggests, I think, is that openness has a presence
that tells us nothing about its possibility. It might well
be impossible, for all we know; and yet it would still be
present, and could still be described---just as Bergson,
a philosopher himself, describes common sense.

Nor is openness, thus understood, merely receptive and
unthinking, as if it were immune to reflection by
definition. Consider the openness, for example, that we
find in a seminar conversation when it is going well. What
one participant puts forward, another takes up; and by such
turns, the conversation becomes a way, not just to speak, but
to think. Outside seminar, we might call this the sharing
and examining of our opinions; yet there seems no place for
this description inside seminar, and might be called
philosophical rather than conversational. For one's opinion,
so-called, is not just *held* in the conversation, but put
forward as a venture; and to call it an "opinion" in reply
would be a way of *not* taking it up. 

And by such detours, a seminar might be described, that
could never take place. For this description would treat
everything said as an expression of what seems to be so, to
each participant in turn. But if these expressions
are to become a conversation, then what seems so to each,
*must become* so for all. Or to borrow from Bergson, the
conversation depends the seminar's having, or gaining,
a common sense of its own, where how things seem is now how
they are, and what is said from the chairs is about
something on the table. And it is the table, in this sense,
that cannot be described, as if its presence were
impossible. For even as the conversation empties the chairs
to fill the table, for the participants; to any observer, the
chairs stay full, the table left bare. 

But suppose this were enough to convince us that being open
is present, in a sense to be distinguished from its
possibility. Still, the question *how* it is present
would not seem clarified by this distinction, but obscured,
to the point of paradox. For what could it mean to ask *how*
being open is present, if this is *not* a question, even
implicitly, about its possibility?     

# Part Five {#five} 

To think about what the question might mean, I want to
return to Aristotle, for my final passage of the night. This
comes from *De Anima*: 

> Therefore, since everything is a possible object of thought,
mind in order, as Anaxagoras says, to dominate, that is, to
know, must be pure from all admixture; for the co-presence
of what is alien to its nature is a hindrance and a block:
it follows that it too, like the sensitive part, can have no
nature of its own, other than that of having a certain
capacity. Thus, that in the soul which is called mind (by
mind I mean that whereby the soul thinks and judges) is,
before it thinks, not actually any real thing. For this
reason it cannot reasonably be regarded as blended with the
body: if so, it would acquire some quality, e.g. warmth or
cold, or even have an organ like the sensitive faculty: as
it is, it has none. (J.A. Smith translation, III.4) 

This passage, I think, can be read as an answer: how is
being open present? And the answer, to put it simply if
paradoxically, is that being open is present as absent. For
the mind, on Aristotle's account, is nothing before it
thinks; yet this makes it something when it thinks: the
something we call thought. Or that we could more generally
call awareness. Or even more generally, openness. And what
Aristotle says is reflected, I think, in the prepositions we
use for what we might call our achievements in openness.
A perception is something, only in being *of* something.
Just as a thought is something, or a sentence to express
that thought is something, only in being *about* something.
And openness itself is something, only in being *to*
something. Being open is present, then, only in *making*
present; and in that sense, is present as absent.

This answer can clarify, I think, what it means for the
presence of openness *not* to be a matter of its
possibility. For we might say, as if this countered
Aristotle, that being open depends on being embodied. The
eye, after all, makes sight possible, just as the brain
makes thought possible. Still, a thought is not about the
brain that makes it possible, but something else. And it is
this something else, then, that makes the thought present,
while the brain that makes it possible is rendered absent.
Similarly, a perception is not of the eye that makes it
possible, but something else. And it is this something else,
then, that makes the perception present, while the eye that
makes it possible is rendered absent. We can grant that the
body, then, makes our openness possible. But it is just this
that prevents the body from making it present. And we might
say that the body, in this sense, makes it possible to be
*other* than body, in a separation---one might even say
liberation---of the presence of openness from its
possibility. And perhaps this is what Aristotle meant in
saying that the mind is not even blended with the body. 

But I want to take this answer one
step further, and suggest that the presence of openness is
indeed liberated from its possibility, by preceding it. In
other words, the presence of openness is prior to its
possibility. And it is this presence, then, that makes its
possibility possible.  

But what did I just say? And what could I mean?  

To make the suggestion more concrete, let us suppose that
I am having a thought right now about my lecture, as
I deliver it. Since this thought is about my lecture, it is
my lecture that makes my thought present; and rendered
absent, then, is anything about me that makes the thought
possible. But since the thought is also mine, we could say
that its presence is mine, and my absence from it in turn.
In other words, since the thought is mine and no one else's,
the lecture makes the thought present to me *and no one
else*. But this implies that whatever it is about me that
makes the thought possible, is rendered absent to me *and no
one else*. In still other words, the way I am absent from my
thought is not the way I might be negated by it, or have
vanished in it, or made invisible. It is rather the way
I might be made visible by it, or exposed, or naked. Or as
if I left my body bereft, rather than behind, in
becoming *other* than body in my thought.

- Introduce possibility here, in abstract form. The body
that makes my openness possible is present in a world
that includes me, but as if it excluded me, since
this exclusion is what makes me *open* to the world rather
than simply in the world. were without me, 

But to make this suggestion still more concrete, I want to
return to the open jar that prompted my I started with, in
my wonder about the word "open". For if the jar could know
it was open, perhaps the absence of its lid would be present
to it, in a feeling of exposure, where it no longer knew
whether its inside were still inside, or now outside. 

could think of this as the price the body pays for what
it makes possible: for I can only be *other* than
body, on this account, not by leaving the body behind,
but instead by leaving it bereft.

might think of this as the price the body pays for what it
makes possible: for to be *other* than body, on this answer,
is not to leave the body behind, but instead to leave it
bereft. 


- Bring up jar and podium stuff, then selfhood.
- Exposure the price of openness.

- Ground for openness needs to be found. 
- Find clothes for a body, self for soul.

I think we can take this answer further, in light of earlier
themes. One of those themes, could it mean that the mind is nothing before it thinks, as if
it had nothing to do with the body, as Aristotle himself
seems to infer? 

Well, yes, I want to say on Aristotle's behalf, but not
because the mind is separate from the body. It is rather---
to anticipate what I will now try to show---because
the mind leaves the body behind, and even bereft. And this
makes the answer to draw from Aristotle more earthly than
otherworldly. What I hope to show now, Athere is a way of making sense of this
inference, where the body is indeed left behind by the mind,
but in a sense that leaves it bereft. And what does the word
"absent" in the ansnBut it can be difficult, in particular,
to believe that the mind is nothing before it thinks, and
has nothing, then, to do with the body, or so Aristotle
seems to infer. So I want to give a second answer to the
question, that matches the first in form, but pays more
attention to the body, yet at the same time revisits an
earlier suggestion: that the presence of openness is *not*
a matter of its possibility. 

In this second answer, then, being open is again present as
absent. But now let us assume that the mind is something
before it thinks; and let us call this something "the body".
And the body, thus understood, makes thinking possible. Now
suppose that I am once again having a thought about my
lecture, a thought made possible, again, by my body. Still,
it is my lecture that makes my thought present, since my
thought is *about* the lecture. But my thought, then, is not
about my body, which renders it absent, at just the moment,
to just the extent, my thought is made present. Or more
generally put: my thought about my lecture can only become
present in the light, as it were, of an absence: the absence
of whatever it is *about me*, rather than my lecture, that
makes my thought possible. And the same might be said, even
more generally, of whatever it is *about us* that makes our
openness possible---from the eyes of sight to the self of
awareness. It in only in their absence that our openness can
gain its presence, even as they make this openness possible.
And in the absence of what makes this openness possible, its
presence is separated---one might even say
liberated---from its possibility.

But this, again, is a second answer to the question how
being open is present. I call it second, because it too
can sound other-worldly, as if our body could vanish, along
with our selfhood, to leave us open, as if by magic. So
I now want to give a last answer to the question, that
changes the second answer in only one respect, but with
a radical effect. It obliges us to pay full attention to the
body, yet at the same time allows us to revisit an earlier
suggestion: that we are open *without* being enclosed, even
by our selfhood.

Here, then, is the change: in the second answer, about my
lecture-thought, it is my lecture that made my
thought present, since my thought is *about* my lecture. But
we can make this more exact, since my thought is also
*mine*. My lecture, then, makes my thought about it present
*to me*. And my body, in turn, is rendered absent *to me*.
Or to put my status here even more exactly: my
lecture makes my thought about it present to me *and no one
else*; while my body, then, is rendered absent to me *and no
one else.*  

What makes this change to the answer radical, I think, is
that it describes the absence of my body as if my body were
made visible by my thought rather than invisible, in an
exposing of my body rather than a vanishing. But what
could the exposing of my body mean, in this context? And exposure
has been lurking in my lecture almost from the start. The
paradox of an open jar, for example, was in how it could
have an inside, in any sense but name, if this inside were
exposed to the outside. And in a later version of the
paradox, where our selfhood enclosed us in openness,
I briefly mentioned why I might be anxious behind this
podium, as if this were caused by my feeling alone. But
a better account, perhaps, is that I am feeling exposed. And
such an anxiety can become existential, in a deepening of my
exposure, where my body is simply *there*, for anyone to see
but me. For I *am* my body, to anyone else; but to me,
I am *in* my body, without knowing how, or why, or even
where. For the way I *am* my body makes it easy to say where
I am---behind this podium. But the way I am *in* my body
makes it hard to say where I am, since in that sense, I am
*always* where I am; and this puts the podium, for the
moment, in front of me. 

Dislocation, embodiment.

Or to borrow a Biblical term for the contrast:
the body is not negated in thought, but naked in thought. 

You would say I am behind the podium, as if I had a place;
whereas I would say the podium was in front of me, as
if the podium had a place. I have a place for you,
that I don't have for myself. r to
put my dislocation in spatial terms, we
could say that I am behind this podium for you, as if I had
a place, but for me, it is the podium that has a place, in
front of me, as if I were placeless. always in a place for you, for example,
behind this podium. But I am never in a place for me,
since might say that I am always in a place for you, for example
behind this podium, but never in a place for me, since it
is everything but me that has a place. I
have a place behind this podium, for all of you, but there
is no such place for me, since it is the podium that
has a place in front of me. am
behind this podium for all of you, but the podium is therefore
placed in front of me. (Okay, this is good; place, hiding
out.) and might crouch further
behind it as if to hide; but since the podium is in front
of me, there is no hiding behind
it for I have
a place behind this podium, for all of you, and as if
I could hide, but no such
place for me, since the podium lies before me, And
this locates me behind the podium, for all of you, while
foAnd
because I am in my body, I see this podium in front of me,Or
to put the way my openness dislocates me another way: we
I have
a place behind this podium, for all of you, but no such place
for myself, since the podium is in front of me, 

My body
behind this podium has a place in the world for all of you,
but it has no such place for me, which is the price I pay
for inhabiting this place And
my ignorance about this, according to my last answer, is
tied to how I cannot know my body if I am to know. 

as if I were sent into the
world for reasons unknown, or fell from a place I can
no longer recall. 

And if my last answer is right, this body
is the price we pay for our openness, which leaves our body
exposed,  when we open our eyes and see a whole world
outside us: for this means we cannot locate ourselves inside
the world we see.

borrow a biblical term for the effect: the body is rendered

the body that makes it possible the body is negated in
thought not made null, but instead made naked, negated, but
naked, in my thought, but naked. we have moved, I think,

way my openness makes me naked.

Disjunction of mind and body, experience of soul.

Mention jar, exposure. The price for seeing a whole world
outside us, as if we saw it from no point of view, is to
lack any account of why we are there, at a seemingly
arbitrary point of view. It is as if we were sent into the world,
but without knowing why; or as if we were fallen, from
a place in the world we can no longer recall. 

To find a place to stand in the world, with an upright
posture we can call our own. Selfhood is not something we
have, but something we find Nakedness, being unlocated from
my point of view, but precisely located from everyone else's
pointed of view. 

To have a body that leaves my existence unexplained.

radical about our selfhood, I think, that our openness can
only be present to us if we are not selves, our openness is
not a matter of having selves, but rather---I do take this
answer to suggest that if we are open, in the end, it is
because we haveour opennesswe have no selves to speak of 

being enclosed. Introduction to next answer: second answer
still somewhat otherworldly, since the brain is introduced
only to vanish. The self vanishes, we have souls.

Next answer: I am at the podium, exposed.

Enclothed in openness. 

Why the word open *is* enough to introduce us.

Marionette is one word, Puppet is another. 
If these things were possible, there would be no wonder.

Next answer: presence liberated from possibility by being prior.

Being open is also absent as present. Exposure.
Jar. At the podium.  

If I think about my lecture, for example, there is
nothing in my thought but the lecture, as if it *were* the
lecture; but it is not the lecture; only a thought about the
lecture. . ; only a thought about the lecture. ; yet the
lecture is not the thought; it is only what the thought is
about. The lecture, we could say, makes the thought about it
present to me, but as the absence of, butven though the
lecture is not the thought. . The lecture makes the thought
present to me, bit is my lecture that makes my thought
present to me, and there is nothing in the thought apart
from the lecture. which means it is absent, we would say the
thought is aboutit is my lecture that makes the thought
present to me, but there is nothing I could say I am open,
for example, when I think about my lecture, but what it
means for this thought to be present to me is not to have
any reality of its own, since this thought is present to
mehave a thought about my lecture, f, for example, I have
a thought about my lecture, the thought is present in being
about my lecture, but therefore absent, in having no nature

How I think, for example, is no part of what I think, and
just as how I see is no part of what I see, (The openness we
call "thought", for example, has its presence is what is
thought about, but this means that thought in itself, apart
from what is thought about, is absent. its presence Maybe
here include bit from quote: mind, in order to think, can
have no nature of its own.) (And in this absence vanishes
its possibility. But what have I just said?) To make this
answer more concrete, and more rooted in the quoted passage,
let us suppose that thought is a way of being open, and that


- Need to re-write more simply, more closely to passage,
and perhaps not so paradoxically about the relation of
presence to possibility.

- One formulation that might work: how I see is no part
of what I see; how I think is no part of what I think;
how I am open is no part of what I am open to. Or to put
this more ambiguously, what opens me, is one sense
my eye, but in another sense what I see with my eye;
similarly for how I think. How my
openness is possible, then, is no part of how my openness
is present. 

Or to say this
perhaps less paradoxically, at the point my thought
is present, this presence is separated---one might say
even liberated---from its possibility. describe
this point perhaps less paradoxically, the  presence of my
thought is separated, or even liberated, from its
possibility.  

- Presence of openness depends on having a soul, not a
self.

- To claim that it isn't possible for the eyes and brain to vanish, 
the answer might be: exactly, and this is why presence has nothing
to with the their possibility.  But clarify this in final
section.
doesn't vanish 



- This is true for eyes and awareness, and so selfhood.

- Then make presence prior to possibility.
 

and present as an example of openness,
in this case to the lecture my thought is about. 
open, then it might be the brain that makes it possible. But
the brain cannot make it actual, since the thought, whatever
it might be about, is not about the brain that makes it
possible. The brain, in this sense, is absent, not present;
and it pays the price of vanishing from what it makes
possible, if this is indeed openness. and while it may make
openness possible, the price in not present to thought, and
therefore absent. that makes it possible is not present to
thought, , in this sense, is absent from thought, in not
being present to thought. as nothing to do with the thought,
is absent, not present, has nothing to do with the thought,
. it is only the absence of the brain that can make it
actual, since the thought is not about the brain., We might
explain the possibility of thought, for example, by
reference to the brain. But we lose this reference, on
Aristotle's account, once we acknowledge the actuality of
the thought. For this is to acknowledge the presence of what
the thought is *about*, and therefore which renders the and
therefore the absence, .If we try, for example, to explain
the possibility of thought, we might appeal to the brain and
how it functions. Yet it is precisely the brain, on
Aristotle's account, along with every other part of our
body, that we must treat as absent, not present, to
acknowledge the actuality of thought, which is to say, the
presence of what the thought is *about*. 

if
thought is be not just possible, but actual, in whatever
is being thought *about*, to acknowledge the
actuality of thought, on Aristotle's account, it is
precisely the brain, along with every other part of the
body, that we must consider or any other part of the body,
if we tried to eon this account, it is if mind is know, it
must be pure, but this means that it must be nothing actual
in itself. 

- This part: quote from Aristotle clarifies presence from
  possibility. 
 
 Price of openness: no way to account for possibility.

- Being open is present as a kind of of
  absence. And our own being open is not enclosed by the
  self, because the self is absent. Or to put this absence
  of the self in positive terms: our own being open is
  present, in our having souls rather than selves. 

- Anxiety at podium

- Being open is present in wonder? Impossibility of
objects of wonder. The wonder in the word
"open" is the wonder not simply provoked by the word, but
meant by the word. Another word for open, is wonder.
- Don't forget distinction between self and soul here.

Impossibility of seminar: happens at table, not chairs;
yet chairs are full, table is bare.

- We have a vocabulary for talking about seminar
outside of seminar (like "the examining of opinions")
but inside seminar this vocabulary is beside the
point. Or even more exactly: to use it is not a way
of advancing the conversation, but of interrupting
it, or even of bringing it to a halt. Not just
words like "claim" or "opinion" or "thought", but
that was interesting, that was helpful, etc. We
enclose the seminar and its openness in this
vocabulary. 

- The table is not enclosed, or covered, but open.
So large, to seat all of us around it, that most
of lays bare. 

- What you say in the conversation is not opining,
or asserting, but venturing. Put something forward
to be taken up, and built upon: metaphors of the hand, of contact,
of reaching beyond the self, non-spectatorial.
As if what we said were tangible rather than ethereal.

From Statement of St. John's Program, about seminar:

first,all opinions must be heard and explored, however
sharply they may clash; second, every opinion must be
supported by argument

- Goes somewhere, but not to a destination.

- Thought is yours, but said to be made ours, about
something. 

- This vocabulary is borrowed from the philosophical
lexicon. (Perhaps look at earlier draft for list of
words; and perhaps look at Oakeshott essay.) It is
a lexicon that separates seeming from being.

- Look below at how I was describing seminar. (Or
is this stuff now in a leftover file?)

- Giving names to what we say, or what we think,
is not a way of putting them forth, or
taking them up. It is not a way of making
a place for them on the table. But what,
without a name, is the "what"?

    - Seminar: From outside seminar it may seem we merely
      express points of view; but from inside seminar, to
      hear what you say this way would be to miss your
      point, or even dismiss your point. What you said takes
      precedence over why you said it, just as why you said
      it in terms of reasons, takes precedence over why you
      said it in terms of symptoms. For the point you try to
      make, is not the point from which you make it, but at
      the other end, infinitely far away. Words are not
      simply signs of something, but symbols for something
      else. They are about something, even if also from
      something. 

- seminar: What we bring to the table is one thing; what
      happens at the table, in front of everyone, is another
      thing. 
    - Seminar: To listen as if I had a point of view is not
      to appreciate my point, but to dismiss. This point
      like the point of perspective. Point I am trying to
      make is not the point of which I make it. Point I am
      trying to make not meant to reflect my point of view
      but transcend it. 

- In seminar, something on the table, not
just in the chairs.

- Perhaps for "what" I can use what I say or
think is *about*.

- Put something forward; take it up; metaphors of
hands and arms, openness.

- A table on which something might be built.

- Once we leave names behind, we move from
how things seem to how things are; or rather:
how things seem *become* how they are, as
any name that divides them is left behind.

- Somewhere incorporate the idea that
we are open in the conversation by leaving the
self behind. It isn't enough to acknowledge
each other, or our points, in a seminar.

- Perhaps I could use this distinction: I have
bringing my point of view to bear on the conversation,
but this point is different from, and in a sense opposite
from, the point I am trying to make. 

- In first catalog, we had tutorials, and seminars, and
  laboratories, lectures, and a reading list, but we did not
  have conversations. Or rather, we had them, presumably,
  but no mention of them appears in the first catalog; and
  I like to think their importance to our way of learning
  was discovered over time rather than invented on the spot.
  But there is a kind of chasm between what happens in
  a seminar conversation and what we
  say happens.   is means our way of describing this
  importance is borrowed.

And if we ask the question how being open is present, then, 
But since ere we have another paradox, 
Nor is this the only description that might be made of
openness in this sense.  (Common, as shared. Examples.)

But now
suppose we if
we accept this description, and then ask *how* is it
present, 

- Passage would still be true, even if philosophical
speculation were sound; it leaves common sense
untouched. 

- Separate presentness from possibility in this.
Passage about the presence of openness. Not just in
description of sameness of seeming and being, but
in the immunity of common sense to speculation.

This is most obvious in Bergson's description of the
content in common sense, which we might gloss 

- Here introduce "common", as self-transcendence, and go
straight to seminar. Then music. Then Lobachevski. 

But common sense, so described, can sound naive, especially
if we are fond of philosophical speculation. Yet this,
I think, is almost the opposite of what Bergson intends by
the contrast between them. The difference between
speculation and sense, in this passage, is something like
the difference between the otherworldly and the worldly. Or
like the difference, to recall *Middlemarch* again, between
Dorothea and her sister Celia. And when common sense is
astonished at the news that how things seem is not how they
are, it is like the astonishment of Celia at the news of her
sister's engagement to Causabon: it is not naive of common
sense, but knowing, to be astonished. For why deny
what is plain as day? Causabon is clearly
unsuited for Dorothea, even if she refuses to see it; just
as things more generally clearly show what they are, even if
a philosopher refuses to see it. 

For the difference between seeming and being How
things seem is no longer how they are, the astonishment of
common sense is something like the astonishment , A better word than "naive"
would be "worldly", And a better for common sense,

better term for it, I think, is worldly, in contrast to
otherworldly. It is the virtue, to recall *Middlemarch*
again, that Eliot attributes to Dorothea's sister, Celia, in
contrast to Dorothea herself. The sense in which common
sense takes how things seem is how things are it is this
claim we are more likely to find incredible, even from the
standpoint of common sense. For how could the way things
seem be the way things are? And what is common sense, if not
a lesson in their difference? And a lesson writ large in
a book like *Middlemarch*? I need not be Dorothea to mistake
one thing for another; and when I do, it is common sense to
catch myself, and correct myself. Or if I see a pair of
railroad tracks, or highway lines, converge to a point in
the distance, I would lack common sense if I doubted they
were parallel, despite their look.  

But this, I think, is the common sense that Bergson
describes. His description, however, invites us to re-think
its lesson. When I mistake one thing for another, but catch
and correct myself, the difference between seeming and being
is not being maintained, but resolved. To maintain it would
take an act of thought *beyond* common sense, like Plato's
cave, or Descartes' deceiver. And as these examples suggest,
this thought will be more like a postulate than like
a phenomenon, even if it convinces us to distinguish seeming
from being as a matter of principle. This conviction will
never make the world look like a cave to common sense, or
allow it to discover the deceiver. 

Nor will parallels ever look otherwise, even in convergence
to a point. For in this convergence, to common sense, the
distance between parallels is not decreasing, but receding.
And the same is true of any object of sight: as it gets closer
or farther away, its look, to common sense, will not be that it
grows or shrinks, but that it approaches or retreats. And if
objects are to look otherwise, such as parallels that look
indeed like they converge, it will again take an act of
thought beyond common sense, in this case involving the
postulate of parallels that Lobachevski strips from Euclid,
leaving the geometric world in a state to astonish the
seniors, where how things seem is no longer how they are. 

But if common sense can be so astonished, at acts of thought
beyond it, then why not consider it naive, like a Euclid
lacking in rigor? (Revise from here.) Or contented, hastened, like a Hume grown tired If the lesson of common sense is
that seeming and being are the same, yet it possible Why is the lesson of common sense a form of wisdom rather than ignorance, if the lesson  
,to learn, as it were, that seeming and
being are the same, as if we were open without being
enclosed, then the way things
seem is the way things are, Why not take itsthe lesson of common
sense is that how things seem 

Here, too, I think the passage from
Bergson invites us to re-think the lesson in common sense,
especially if we take the word "common" to mean "shared",
and think of examples where we share. (Revise from here,
perhaps use "lesson" language from above again.)

One answer, I think, is lurking in
the word "common", if we take it to mean "shared", and
think of what we share there are other ways into the passage of
Bergson, and the presence of openness that it describes, to
make common sense look enlightened. Outside seminar, for
example, we might talk as if it involved the examining of
opinions. But this is also to talk as if the seminar
contained chairs without a table. For inside seminar, having
your point be called an opinion is a way of dismissing it
rather than pursuing it, and as if you were speaking from
your chair rather than putting something on the table.
, rather than attempting to put something on the table.
Philosophical speculation may even have convinced you that,
yes, your point was indeed an opinion, and perhaps nothing
more. But in the seminar it has to become something more to
make the conversation move forward. Or to put this another
way, your point might just be your opinion, but this is  And
it becomes something more at the table, And we could say
that the common sense of seminar and that you are so
enclosed in your openness that ; We may have perfectly good
reasons, Outside seminar, in other words, we talk as if we
were enclosed in openness and could only , And the
difference between being outside and inside seminar is like
the difference between being outside and inside common
sense. would feel like a way of dismissing it rather than
And behind this talk there would be much philosophical
speculation ,is sometimes thought to lack the kowing rigor
of a modern, without the rigor of a modern, But suppose
common sense were deceived in this. There would be no way
for common sense to discover it, or allow us to accept it,
without something like astonishment. For if there is to be
a real difference between seeming and being, where parallel
lines can look otherwise, or straight lines can look
otherwise, or objects in general can look otherwise, then
the difference---as we learn from Lobachevski---will rest on
a postulate rather than phenomenon, and only challenge
common sense by contradicting it. Or to broaden the point,
we could say that for common sense, any difference between
seeming and being can be resolved, as I can catch myself,
and correct myself, when I mistake one thing for another. To
maintain the difference rather than resolve it, then, will
take an act of thought *beyond* common sense, and contrary
to it. We will need Plato's cave, or Descartes' deceiver, or
some like appeal to what, again, we might call a postulate
rather than phenomenon, to persuade us that the way things
seem is *not* the way they are. For even if we are
persuaded, the way things seem *will seem* like the way they
are. The world will never look like a cave to common sense,
and the deceiver will never be discovered.

Nor is common sense naive in this, a sign of which lurks in
the word "common", if we take it not to mean "low", but
rather to mean "shared." For what we can share gives us
another way into the passage from Bergson, the presence of
openness, and the enlightenment, as we might call it, in
common sense. When we sing in chorus, for example, there is
no enlightenment in a lesson of the difference between
seeming and being. For if we are reminded of our voices as
we sing, and how they sound *apart* from the song, we
distinguish being from seeming at the risk of ruin, as we
hear our voices too severally as *ours*, to hear them
together, as a chorus, in song. And this is proof, of
a sort, that there is music only if the way things seem
becomes the way they are, as the sound of our voices forms
a world of tones onto itself, and every event in that world
is a matter of sense, explained by what we hear. The result
would be cacophony to common sense, and only a philosophical
speculation beyond common sense even if we took it as proof
that music is mere appearance, , illusion, it philosophical
speculation The philosopher in us might be amused at the
cacophonous effect, And music, in this way, is a matter of
common sense.   

how our voices sound is less likely to underline
thTo be told this world of tones is simply an appearance, of
the sound of our voices our voices *as* voices is below this
what what we hear, , at any level below what we hear is more
likely to ruin the chorus than explicable in terms of
consonance and dissonance, stability and instability, as if
it were caused by consonance, or dissonance, justified in
the aural light of consonance and dissonance, what we sense
of consonance and dissonance, stability and instability, and
we hearour sense of stability and instability, we must take
the way things seem to be the way they are:  another way
into the passage from Bergson, to appreciate the presence of
openness in Bergson's passage. (Music.) And to think of our
sharing in sense gives us another way to appreciate the
passage from Bergson.  (Revise from here; reserve word
"perspective" for later point about Lobachevski.) (Seminar
composed of chairs, but also a table in common.) Outside of
seminar, for example, we sometimes talk of the conversation
in seminar as if it were the examining of opinions. But
inside of seminar, to have something you say *be called* an
opinion will feel, most likely, as if your point was being
dismissed rather than grasped. And you will feel it even if
you agree, philosophically let us say, that what you said is
indeed your opinion or perspective. say is in some sense it
was yourself believe that what you said involved
a perspective. And you will feel this way even if you
believe that what you said, r belief this feeling won't be
changed

is more likely a way of dismissing it than
accepting it, much less understanding it. to dismiss it than to understand
it. less likely a sign that your point
is being understood not be a way of accepting it,
or understanding, but instead a way of dismissing it. your point,
or understanding it, is a way of dismissing what you say
rather than understanding it. 

And in being
a postulate, what persuades will never be perceived. The
world will never look like a cave to common sense, and the
deceiver will never be discover, exposed. (Mention seminar
here, and find a way to incorporate Euclidean.) 

, to tell us persuade us that we may never see
things as they are, And the most famous examples of acts of
thought in this sense---Plato's allegory of the cave;
Descartes' his is why our most famous examples of , in this
sense, therefore requires an act of thought beyond common
sense, bounds, ,   

- So it requires acts of thought, positing
things that cannot be seen, to make sense of the difference
between being and seeming in general.

- Example of how we are left untouched, even if persuaded:
seminar.

- Lobachevski another act of thought.

Bergson's account can also remind us that the
deepest arguments against our openness in this sense---which
is to say, the deepest arguments that the way things seem is
*not* the way they are---require acts of philosophical
thought that are uncommon, even heroic. It takes the likes
of Plato's allegory of the cave, or Descartes' *malin
génie*, to establish the difference between being and
seeming in general, since this difference in particular is an
everyday experience of common sense, in mistakes of
perception that we can catch, and correct, as if to
punctuate our openness before a word of philosophical
speculation might tempt us, instead, to cross it out. 
And there is also a way that philosophical speculation
can persuade us on the outside while leaving us untouched
on the inside. can leave our *experience* of Bergson's account might be extended even to our
deepest moments of thought. 



what might be called

uncommon acts, even heroic acts, of thought: And together, these are marks of  

If we were truly open, how things seem would be how things
are. But this is how they are for common sense, where
the object at once exists in itself and is *as* we perceive
it. 

FHow is being open present: 
    - For common sense, how things seem is how things are.
    - Common sense is immune to philosophical reflection. 
    - Philosophical reflection, how things seem is *not* how
    things are. It is predicated on the difference between
    seeming and being. 

- Also mention from quote that philosophical reflection can
be identified with being enclosed: cannot get "outside"
oneself. This is perhaps the most compelling argument against
being open: that if we were open, how things seem would be
how things are. But philosophy predicated on diference
between seeming and being. 
- Perhaps mention Descartes in this context: to separate
seeming from being requires more than an appeal to the
deceptions in perception, for these are local, not
global, and self-correcting. You need a more general
comparison involving all of wakeful life, either in
dreaming, or in a deceptive being outside me. Also
compare to Plato. Platonic cave. A prisoner "unchained",
but how? By whom? needs malicious
  demon to really get seeming separated from being.
No continuity between seeming and being; need break.

To clarify what I mean, consider this
passage, from a book by Bergson:  

- Comment on this passage: if being open were possible,
this is how it would be. But in this passage, openness
is not possible, but present. And the way it is present
is by being immune to philosophy.

<!--Perhaps obvious that from the inside the inside cannot
be told, like being in a cave. But how do we get from
inside to outside to tell it. Strengthen sense in which
the inside seems sufficient. And what distinguishes
the outside in which we are always outside ourselves,
from the outside in which we are always inside ourselves?
Also, in below, perhaps make explicit the inference
from awareness to being outside ourselves more generally.
-->

What Bergson attributes here to common sense, we can take to
be what awareness is like from inside it. And from the
inside, awareness is nothing but openness. The way things
seem is the way things are, as if we saw them from *no*
point of view, and were outside ourselves as a matter of
course. And to suspect otherwise; to think we are never
outside ourselves wholly; to suppose we always see things
from a point of view; to doubt that the way things seem is
ever the way things are---this is what awareness is like
from outside it, or from what Bergson attributes here to the
speculations of philosophy. From the outside, then,
awareness is always enclosed in openness. And if our
selfhood is what encloses it, then we have a way to sharpen
our paradox to a kind of point: for we could say it is only
from outside ourselves that we can see ourselves enclosed;
only from outside ourselves that we come to see the self we
are always inside of; the self that makes being outside
ourselves questionable, and even impossible: a contradiction
in terms. But if it *is* a contradiction in terms, then how
did we get outside ourselves to see it, and why is that not
enough to contradict the contradiction? 

<!--Note, this stretch should be connected to previous
part, in that we are not open to self and other at once.-->

In other words, what distinguishes the outside within, where
we are always outside ourselves, and nothing but openness,
from the outside without, where we are always inside
ourselves, and enclosed in openness? And how are we ever
carried from the one outside to the other? (Note: should
make this the true sense of openness.) If the way things
seem is the way things are, from within awareness, then how
do we ever escape awareness, as if from a cave, to see, with
self-awareness, that the way things seem is *not* the way
they are? If common-sense, as Bergson describes this, is
adequate enough to make astonishing the speculations of
philosophy against that adequacy, then how do these
speculations ever arise, much less become convincing? What
makes philosophy possible? What makes wonder possible? What
makes openness possible? 

# Leftovers

- Point: there is already enough transcendence inside
  awareness to make us wonder how we ever get outside it. 
- Philosphical reflection is superfluous.
- Then mention perspective in relation to Lobachevski.
    - It can seem as easy to separate seeming from being by
      noting that parallel tracks don't "look" parallel.
    - But in fact they do look parallel. The convergence,
    in this case, belongs to their increasing distance from
    us, not to their.  
    - Sameness of proportion is sameness of being. Difference
    in size sameness of being.

- How things seem is how things are: sameness of proportion is a
sameness of identity, and allows us to see (objects appear at
various distances.)

Problem of consciousness: no continuity between world of perception
and world of embodiment. Gap in explanation. Gap between what it
is and what it is like. Dislocation.

Freud: deepening of self; but alternative, the conceiving of
a self.

Use Euclid vs Lobachevski as difference between infinity that preserves appearance vs finitude that undermines it. 
- Music: The sounds of instruments in an orchestra become
  a world of tones unto itself, with movements justified by
  consonance and dissonance. 
    - Making the way things seem the way they are: the art
      of music. Making them seem all the more the way they
      are, in movements justified by dissonance, and
      consonance. But from outside this world, it can be
      reduced to the look of a student in headphones,
      utterly withdrawn from the way things are.
- The problem here is really a Platonic one.
    - Mention how it can be too easy to suppose we really
      live in a cave. 
    - Seminar: we take to be opinions, or perspectives, but
      really not.
    - Seminar: there is something on the table, not just in
      the chairs.
    - Seminar: From outside seminar it may seem we merely
      express points of view; but from inside seminar, to
      hear what you say this way would be to miss your
      point, or even dismiss your point. What you said takes
      precedence over why you said it, just as why you said
      it in terms of reasons, takes precedence over why you
      said it in terms of symptoms. For the point you try to
      make, is not the point from which you make it, but at
      the other end, infinitely far away. Words are not
      simply signs of something, but symbols for something
      else. They are about something, even if also from
      something. 
      
Other related lecture thoughts: 
- Does world in which I am embodied precede or follow world
  in which I am intelligent? 
- Sign: my sense of disorientation in not knowing why I am
  here. Why I exist
- Music not a perspective: tones separated from instruments,
  made a world onto itself, where how things look, or sound,
  us how they are. 
- Use of language: to listen to me as if I were expressing
  a perspective, rooted in myself, is a way missing or
  dismissing my point, rather than understanding it.
  (Despite our calling conversations a sharing of
  perspective). This shows how language is about something,
  not from something. 
- Point of view in music negated or made absolute: since
  every point is now. In time. 
- Point of view in perspective is not where I am, but the
  limit of what I see: vanishing point. q

- Music outside in space, as if we were on the outside.
- Music not a perspective: tones separated from instruments,
  made a world onto itself, where how things look, or sound,
  us how they are. A world unto itself without a point of
  view, or at best, an absolute one, in the now of time. One
  tone a point of view? But organizes the tonal world around
  it. My own center is *the* center. The way things seem (in
  sound) is the way things are.

- Point of view in music negated or made absolute: since

- Point of view in perspective is not where I am, but the
  limit of what I see: vanishing point.
- Another thought: point of view suggests that line radiate
  from it. But in perspective, lines converge on points, at
  at infinite distance (if Euclidian), making the point of
  view, measured back from that distance of convergence,
  infinite in size, as if I were everywhere rather than
  somewhere. 
- Language for thought as perspectiveless in being about
  something. 
- Point of view most familiar to us from perception, say of
  vision. 
- Aristotle: invisibility of self (presence of soul)
    - Invisibility not contained in circle; no point
    - Nakedness and anxiety also evidence of this
    - Aristotle’s account of awareness in soul not self has
      this evidence for it: we are not a part of what we
      see, and can only reintroduce ourselves into what we
      see bodily. 
    - Note: center of circle still within circle. (Not
      invisible as in Aristotle account.)
    - anxiety at podium revisited
    - sense of thrownness
    - Aristotle writes about the soul, not the self. 
    - Self is found before it is founded
    - seminar: What we bring to the table is one thing; what
      happens at the table, in front of everyone, is another
      thing. 
    - Seminar: To listen as if I had a point of view is not
      to appreciate my point, but to dismiss. This point
      like the point of perspective. Point I am trying to
      make is not the point of which I make it. Point I am
      trying to make not meant to reflect my point of view
      but transcend it. 
    - sight that doesn't include me means it is an
      appearance behind which lies a reality. 
- Things become what they sound like: being as location.
  Harmony. Contrast to dislocation. Music expression of
  outwardbess, not inwardbess
- Lecture: nakedness not a need to be covered, but to be
  placed. Not a matter of inside and outside but of place.
  Music is calming in this way. 
- anxiety might mean you have a deep self, but it could mean
  you have no self. Problem of having no self. 
- Nakedness and dislocation: not having clothes, not having
  a home. Dislocation of awareness, finding, not having,
  a point of view, a place to stand. Link to education in
  the end Nakedness and dislocation: not having clothes, not
  having a home. Dislocation of awareness, finding, not
  having, a point of view, a place to stand. Link to
  education in the end 
- Three things to recommend Aristotle: invisibility,
  anxiety, soul rather than self
- Also: invisibility of self is really visibility, outside
  self, and dislocation with respect to self.
- Lobachevski: mathematical image of things not being as
  they seem, but predicated on uncertainty 
- Idea of self from looking at the self from outside it,
  self refuting. Or more generously, self is our way of
  locating ourselves inside the self. We are not enclosed
  but enclothed. Only outside the self that we can look
  enclosed by the self. So it is the case that we are open,
  but look closed.  
- Return to wonder by end: Science leaves no place for us to
  find in the world Wonder is about one's place in the
  world.
    - Can being sent into world be linked to wonder?
    - Diagonal alongside the square. (No hiddeness in
      world.)
    - Cause of wonder not behind what we see, but beside
      what we see. 
    - Idea: wonder not suspicion. Wonder linked to
      disorientation, of being sent into the world.
      Explanation is a way to justify what we see, not to
      undermine what we see (as science does). Science takes
      our embodiment to be a given to be explained, by
      mechanical causality. Philosophy takes our embodiment
      to be achievement, to be justified by final causality.
    - Thales water: reality behind appearance not
      theological or scientific. Water has to remain water. 
     - Self refuting nature of self
     - Self a way to locate us
     - Wonder only possible in soul

[^Socrates]: "...it is the function of the philosopher to be able
to investigate all things. For if it is not the function of
the philosopher, who is it who will inquire whether Socrates
and Socrates seated are the same thing, or whether one thing
has one contrary, or what contrariety is, or how many
meanings it has? And similarly with all other such
questions." (Book IV, Part 2, *Metaphysics*)
