My lecture tonight is in three parts.

# Part One {#one}

We use the word "open" in ways that range from the prosaic
to the profound:

    - "I can't get the jar open."
    - "When does the store open?"
    - "The window is open."
    - "He's an open book." 
    - "She greeted them with open arms."
    - "My door is always open."
    - "Keep an open mind."
    - "Open your heart."
    - "My eyes were finally opened."

But why does the word have such scope? This is one reason
for wonder.

Another reason is that we use the word, typically,
without further ado, as if its meaning were already
understood. But if so, then how is it understood?
And is there something here not understood? Or better
understood? The difference between a door and an open door
may be like the difference between Socrates and Socrates
sitting. For only a philosopher, according to Aristotle,
would care about this difference.[^Socrates.] But the
philosopher in all of us, then, can wonder about that
difference. We can wonder what it means to say "my door is
always open"---even if asking this of a friend, who just
said it to you, risks being rude. Or dense. The way we use
the word "open" without further thought may make it worth
further thought.

Still another reason for wonder comes from the way we
define the word "open" in dictionaries---largely through
negation. To be open means *not* to be closed. Or blocked.
Or covered. Or fastened. Or sealed. Or buttoned. Or guarded.
Or protected. Or folded. Or clenched. Or concealed. Or
constipated.[^Dictionary] This may be definition enough for
everyday use. But what about those deeper moments of speech,
when we talk of eyes being opened? Or arms? Hearts? Minds?
Or again the proverbial door, always open to a friend?
Here we use the word "open" for a positive
condition, a state of being, which any negative definition
at best half-comprehends. And to ask about the meaning of
"open", then, is to ask about the meaning of hospitality,
generosity, enlightenment, love.

Nor are these the only such states of being. Think of how we
say our eyes are open, merely to mean we are awake. But why
say this of our eyes, and not our eyelids, which we might
call "open" more literally? To use the word for our eyes may
be figurative; but it captures how we seem to see *through*
our eyes, as if they were open, or at least transparent, to
a whole world outside us. <!-- This reaching out should be
used in a transition paragraph later.-->  To ask about the
meaning of "open", then, is to ask about the meaning of
wakefulness, watchfulness, awareness. It is to ask about
a way of being that may well be *our* way of being: the one
underneath all the others; the one that explains *why* we
use the word with such scope, and as if it were already
understood.

Awareness might also explain our reliance on
negation to define the word. For in one sense,
a negative sense, being open in awareness means being
*not* ourselves, so far as we are aware of anything else.
<!--Later come back to this idea involving negation, where
we are transformed by awareness into a kind of invisibility.
THis relates to way in which world is *other* to us--> But
negation here seems especially half-comprehending.
For beneath our awareness of anything else is an
awareness we have of ourselves. <!-- Later connect this
point, perhaps, to Adam and Eve and nakedness: the price of
knowledge is the shame of nakedness.--> And this gives the
word "open" a deeper sense of positive scope, as it
comprehends self and other at once, and captures something
that our times of solitude and solicitude have in common.

In this vein, too, the word "open" might have a home in any
community that conceives itself as a community of learning,
and believes, without the blush of contradiction, that
learning best happens among others, yet only happens in
oneself. And if no one else can do your learning for you,
it might take a word like "open" to explain why you don't
find yourself alone at this college, but among others around
a table, face-to-face. To ask about the meaning of "open",
then, is to ask about the meaning of this. The meaning of
us. Just as we can ask, as we look at the cover of the St.
John's viewbook, why the word "open" might be enough to
introduce us. <!--Later refer back to this last sentence,
in trying to rehabilite positive question after arguing
againts its possibility. Something like: does this
impossibility mean that we are guilty of false advertising
on the cover of the St. John's viewbook?-->

[Back to top](#top)



# Part Two {#two}

In all these ways, the word "open" gives us much to wonder
about. But there is another way, I want to suggest, in which
the word gives us just one thing to wonder about. <!--Later
shift: the word gives us the only thing to wonder about. For
wonder depends on being open, and is perhaps the deepest
mark of its possibility.--> And this is by analogy,
borrowing from Aristotle again, to the one thing we can
wonder about when we encounter, as if for the first time,
figures made of wood come to life; or the sun reverse course
one day in the sky; or the diagonal of a square escape
measure by any part of its side, no matter how
small.[^AristotleWonder.] The wonder, in each case, is how
such a thing is possible. <!--Later point out that this
isn't really possible, on a certain philosophical
explanation--> Once we learn how, we can give what we
encounter a name, like "marionette", or "solstice", or
"incommensurable." But these can become words we inherit
rather than originate, to discourage
understanding just as much as display it, as we use the name
for what we don't yet know as if we do. <!--Later return to
this: Aristotle says we end in opposite state from wonder,
which suggests a kind of negation of world in which wonder
began, or an understanding of world that leaves no place for
wonder; just like Aristotle's account of nous. Another way
to describe this: how the cause of wonder ends up being
located in the realm of appearance, to be dispelled by an
account of the reality. Then can move on to Phaedo.-->
<!--Another thought: In moving from an appearance of
openness to its denial in reality, we are thinking
philosophically, yet common life continues to embrace
openness. Could use the Bergson quote here. Then quote from
other others to show the ambivalence of philosophy.-->

The word "open", I suspect, is just such a name. Behind it,
or beneath it, lies a problem, a paradox, to make us wonder
how being open is possible. <!--Later, in transition, point
out that we started perhaps in the attempt to explain how
openness is possible, only to argue that it isn't possible,
or that its an appearance rather than a reality. This is
what philosophical reflection does. (Don't forget Bergson
here.) --> But to wonder how is also unlikely, since we have
the word "open" to prove its possibility. 

If, for example, I say "I can't get the jar open", I will
look for a better grip on the lid, not the word. But even
here, I can wonder about the word. For why get a better grip
on the lid to open the jar? Suppose I decide not to bother
with the lid, and simply throw the jar to the ground,
breaking it open. Why is this not simply another way of
opening the jar? Why say instead that I *broke* the jar
open?

We say this, it seems, in wanting the jar to remain a jar:
something opened *without* being broken. More abstractly put:
we want the word "open" to mean that the barrier between
the jar's inside and outside has been removed, without the
difference between inside and outside being erased. Or still
more abstractly: we want the word "open" to mean that there
is continuity, yet at the same time discontinuity, between
inside and outside.

But here, then, is the paradox. For how can there be
continuity and discontinuity at once? In this case, how is
the jar's inside still inside, and not outside, as soon as
the lid is removed? If we leave the jar open, its contents
may spoil---as if for nature, even if not for us, a lidless
jar has no inside, and can only gain one by being closed.
In what sense, then, can I truly open the jar, no matter
how great my grip on the lid?

This is one way to wonder how being open is possible.
But not the only way. And other ways need make no appeal to nature,
or ruin, if an inside is left open to the outside too
long. Consider a line from geometry: the parabola.
We can distinguish the sides of this line, one convex and
one concave, since the parabola is curved. But suppose we
go further, and take the convex side to be inside the
parabola, and the concave side to be outside. This would
treat the curved line as a figure, analogous to the ellipse,
only open rather than closed. We might even liken this
figure to an lidless, empty jar. But what would justify this
interpretation? Why think that the parabola *has* an inside,
distinct from, but open to, an outside? Why aren't both
sides of the parabola outside it, since both lie outside the
line of the parabola?

To answer this question in defense of the interpretation, we
could make the inside of the parabola definite, by completing
the analogy to the ellipse. We would then take the parabola
to be an infinite ellipse, with one focus infinitely far
away. The parabolic line would then be infinite in length,
with ends that reach the edge, as it were, of the geometric
plane. But in that case, it seems, our parabola will gain a
true inside in just the way our jar possessed one: by being
closed. For there will be no way into the parabola, or out
of it, through its open end, since this now lies infinitely
far away. Or to put the paradox in this case more sharply:
once we make the line of the parabola infinite, to make the
inside of the parabola definite, we will have *enclosed* the
parabola in openness. And this enclosure will make the
openness of the parabola at once intelligible yet
impassable. The way this figure stays open on one side will
be something we can plainly see, even point to, yet never
reach---as if openness had no being but seeming.

This, then, is another way to wonder how being open is
possible. <!--Note later that we wonder this by giving
arguments for its impossibility; and philosophy rests here,
in impossibility. In mere appearance, then go back to
examples from Aristotle, then Bergson.--> And while it might
seem contrived, in coming from mathematics, it suggests
a more general way, and radical way, to wonder how being
open is possible. For what if every way of being open were
like the parabola? That is, what if every way of being open
were really a way of being closed that merely looked open?
What if we ourselves were enclosed in openness?

For example, think again of how we say our eyes are open
when we are awake, to capture how we seem to see *through*
our eyes, as if they were transparent, to a whole world outside
us. But this is also to speak figuratively, and perhaps
somewhat thoughtlessly. If we spoke more thoughtfully about
our eyes, and about our relation to the world through
awareness more generally, we might say something more like
this: 

> "The world is my representation": this is a truth valid
with reference to every living and knowing being, although
man alone can bring it into reflective, abstract
consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical
discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and
certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but
only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth;
that the world around him is there only as representation,
in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely
that which represents, and this is himself.[^WWR]

On this account, our eyes are not transparent but opaque;
we see not through them but with them; to a world not
outside us but inside us, or at least in a relation to us
that is given rather than gained, and renders it always my
representation rather than ever a reality apart.  

And while the passage begins a book by Schopenhauer that is
very long, indebted to the philosophy of Kant, and
"non-program", as we like to say, it is also intelligible,
almost self-evident (as evident as self).  For (make
argument here for why what Schopenhauer says make sense.)

Perhaps make argument here that we could not know the
eyes we see through unless they were, in this sense,
opaque.

Also tie this explicitly to being enclosed in openness.

Schopenhauer here offers a memorable description of what it
means to be enclosed in openness. 

Tie enclosure to self, for next paragraph. The self 
encloses us in openness.

But the passage itself can seem almost self-evident; as
evident, at least, as the self.


Indeed, what if our very selfhood enclosed us in openness?
For the self poses its own paradox of openness, and perhaps
its own resolution in closedness. Consider the power of
awareness, which again might be the openness most our own,
comprehending self and other at once. But how? How can I be
self and other at once? <!--Question this later, suggesting
that I am not self and other at once--> In spatial terms, we
might say that I am carried outside myself, in my awareness
of anything else; yet also kept inside myself, since this
awareness is mine, and known as mine through self-awareness.
But how can awareness put me inside and outside at once? Or
carry me from one to the other, as if the two were
continuous; yet keep me in one rather than the other, as if
the two were discontinuous? How can I be carried outside
myself without losing myself, making openness impossible? Or
kept inside myself without closing myself, again making
openness impossible? The only way, perhaps, is if the self
can bring the outside inside, in something like the way
a jar is closed, or a parabola completed. That is, perhaps
only if the self encloses what lies outside it, can the self
be open to what lies outside it.

This suggestion about our selfhood may sound abstruse, or at
least abstract. 

- From "familiarity" of Schopenhauer move on to commonplace
expression: point of view. 

But we have a commonplace expression to
clarify the suggestion, and make it more concrete, when we
speak of having *a point of view*. Here at the podium, for
example, my awareness gives me a point of view on you in the
audience. And this explains why I can be aware of you
without becoming you, or at least find myself sitting beside
you in the audience. For it seems I remain just where I am,
and what I am, at the point of my point of view. And my
awareness of you, or of anything else, strictly changes
nothing in either my place or my identity. But the very idea
of a point of view comes with a paradox of its own, to
suggest why having a point of view means being enclosed in
openness. For how can a view belong to a point? That is, how
can a whole with many parts belong to that which has no
part? Perhaps in something like the way
a circumference belongs to a center. For in that case, my
awareness of you would not mean that I became you, or
reached you, but instead that I encompassed you. And in that
sense, it seems, I would *contain* you in my point of view,
as if my openness to you were a matter of enclosing you; and
as if we were both, more generally, enclosed in openness,
much like a parabola, and perhaps even more like a circle. 

If anything, the force of this idea is lost in familiarity.
But to make it less familiar, think again of those deeper
moments of speech, where we speak of openness---whether of
eyes, or arms, or mind, or heart--as if it were a state of
being. We can think in turn of rarer moments in life that
justify such speech, where we might want to say that
something *can* change, or *has* changed, in our place or
identity. We could think of these as moments of otherness
that most reveal our openness. Still, it seems easier to
suppose that such moments have done something *to* our point
of view---moved it, altered it, enlarged it, deepened
it---than to suppose they have more simply erased it, or
denied it, or refuted the very idea of it. In other words,
it is easier to suppose that the self might be
transformed, than to suppose that the self could ever be
transcended. But why should this be easier, unless the self
stayed intact enough, or closed enough, to make the
otherness in openness seem a property of self rather than
a negation of self? 

We can find still more support for this idea in the merest
philosophical reflection. For in this context, the merest
such reflection might be that our point of view *is* a point
of view. And if we recognize this, it becomes possible to
question our point of view, or doubt it, or even want to
overcome it, as if we might someday see things from *no*
point of view. See them, that is, as they truly are; as they
are in themselves; as they are *outside* any point of view,
no matter how encompassing. Yet how could we see at all,
without a point of view?  Or ever see beyond it, if seeing
any distance requires it? And if the self in this sense can
never be relinquished, or renounced, what is left but
reconciliation? The self-knowledge of Socratic ignorance? 
The self-certainty of Cartesian doubt? The transcendental
self of Kantian critique? Or the absolute self of Hegelian
dialectic? It can start to seem as if there is nothing at
the end of philosophical reflection but a self to embrace,
since it can never be escaped. We might even make
philosophical reflection a matter of self-embrace from the
start. Consider the way one philosopher does this:

as if

philosophy began in :  chopenhauer does this, to begin
a book thatn the memorable
opening to his *World as Will and Representation*, in the famous We might even embrace
the self at the start of philosophical reflection, It can even start to seem
as if there is nothing at the start of philosophical
reflection, Unless we embrace this self
as the start of philosophical reflection, And it is even possible
to embrace this self at the start of philosophical reflection,


Nor do we need the arguments of philosophy to reach this
conclusion. And other ways of reaching it, as they broaden
its scope to include other selves, can even allow for
the semblance of self-transcendence. <!--Perhaps add to
previous sentence: "at least in modes of openness other
than awareness, like hospitality.--> Consider this passage,
from perhaps the greatest novel in English:

> (797) Rosamond, taken hold of by an emotion stronger than
her own---hurried along in a new movement which gave all things
some new, awful, undefined aspect---could find no words,
but involuntarily she put her lips to Dorothea's forehead
which was very near her, and then for a minute the two women
clasped each other as if they had been in a shipwreck.

Readers of *Middlemarch* may remember this moment. For Eliot
leads us to it from a depiction, in the character of
Rosamond Vincy, of a self that seems incapable of such
a moment: the moment when a life of self-regard reaches
a point of self-release. But this point of self-release, as
Eliot describes it, is in the shipwrecked embrace of another
self, as if there were nothing outside self but self, making
transcendence, in turn, a movement from self to self.

Nor is this the only such moment in the novel. The
other self in the passage above, Dorothea Brooke, is led
to a similar point, in her unhappy first marriage to
Mr. Causabon. Here is how Eliot accounts for it:

> We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world
as an udder to feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early
begun to emerge from that stupidity, but yet it had been
easier to her to imagine how she would devote herself to Mr.
Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his strength and
wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is no
longer reflection but feeling---an idea wrought back to the
directness of sense, like the solidity of objects--that he
had an equivalent centre of self, whence the lights and
shadows must always fall with a certain difference.

On this account, what Dorothea must learn is not that she
married a lesser man, without the strength or wisdom to make
her wise and strong in turn; but rather that she married
another self, which makes her a self in turn, no matter how
selfless she yearns to be. Or to put the lesson another way:
to transcend the self altogether is not simply impossible,
but illusory, since a desire for this can blind one to the
selfhood in others that makes for true transcendence in
recognition, not renunciation. 

Or to put the lesson one last way, that broadens the scope
of recognition: to be open to another, or
to anything other, means regarding it as *more* than other.
But this seems to mean regarding it from a point of view at
which the other is a self, or at least related
to self. That is, it means seeing what is other from
a center at which its otherness can be encompassed by the
self. Or contained. Or enclosed. Which again would mean that
being open, in the end, is a way of being closed, despite
the look otherwise. Or more simply put: being open, truly
and simply open, is impossible. 

# Part Three {#three}

But *is* it impossible? There is yet another passage in
*Middlemarch*, I think, to help us raise this question
anew, and renew our wonder at the word
"open". 

> “For my part I am very sorry for him. It is an uneasy lot
at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to
enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and
never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering
self—never to be fully possessed by the glory we behold,
never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into
the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the
energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and
uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and
dim-sighted.

The subject of this passage, of course, is Edward Causabon.
And Eliot addresses the reader directly, I think, to
persuade us, if not to love him, at least to acknowledge
him, and come to know him, then, as self rather than other,
just as Dorothea must learn to do. It is as if Eliot wants
to *open* us to Causabon, to undergo our own movement of
transcendence, from reader to character, as she gives us
a point of view on Causabon to make him pitiable rather than
contemptible. That is, Eliot gives us a center from which
another can be seen as self, and as if to move us from self
to self, in what again would be the only form of
self-transcendence possible, if our selfhood enclosed
us in openness. 

But what is it, then, that makes Causabon pitiable? For
Eliot writes as if he should be pitied for a self he can
never escape, and as if there were no way to enjoy, and still
be enclosed. For what selfhood is left once we are
possessed, fully, by the glory we behold? Or once our
consciousness is transformed, rapturously, into the
vividness of a thought? The ardor of a passion? The energy
of an action? Eliot writes of enjoyment as if it were an
experience not of satisfaction, but of consummation.
A liberation from the self in need, intelligibly enough; but
where what remains in deliverance, more puzzlingly, is not
the self fulfilled, or even a self at all, but only the
fulfillment itself, with nothing left to fill. 

The puzzle in this, of a self transcended altogether, or of
an openness pure and true, can make it easy to doubt Eliot's
description of enjoyment. We might accuse it of falsely
making what we feel into what we are, when there is no
escape from what we are, even in the most ecstatic feeling
of joy. Once the feeling is gone, we can presume, it will
leave us with a self in need, as if our liberation in joy
were just a dream. Yet Eliot writes her description not to
make joy look exceptional, but to make the man who lacks it
look exceptional. And if we are to pity him, it seems we
must take the self-transcendence in joy that Causabon has
never known to be true rather than false. A matter of fact
rather than a matter for doubt. But this confronts us with
another paradox. For how can we take a matter *as* fact, if
it is easy to doubt? That is, how can we *read* what Eliot
writes about self-transcendence as she intends it, if it is
possible to *doubt* what she writes as she intends it? One
answer is that what Eliot writes about self-transcendence
can be questioned outside the novel, even if it goes
unquestioned inside the novel. But this answer only sharpens
the paradox. For why is it then only outside the novel, and
outside ourselves as readers of the novel, that
a description of being outside ourselves becomes
questionable?

There is an answer to this question too, but it only
sharpens the paradox further. For on this answer, it is only
outside ourselves that being outside ourselves becomes
questionable. Or doubtful. Or even seem impossible. Or to
put the answer another way, that seems to reverse our
earlier conclusion: it is only openness that can make being
open look like a way of being closed. 

making    <!--Focus on
"eye that sees a sun" as example of being enclosed in
openness. Also note that it takes philosophical discernment
to see this. So how?--> 

To clarify what I mean, consider this
passage, from a book by Bergson:  

>It would greatly astonish a man unaware of the speculations
of philosophy if we told him that the object before him,
which he sees and touches, exists only in his mind and for
his mind or even, more generally, exists only for mind, as
Berkeley held. Such a man would always maintain that the
object exists independently of the consciousness which
perceives it. But, on the other hand, we should astonish him
quite as much by telling him that the object is entirely
different from that which is perceived in it, that it has
neither the color ascribed to it by the eye nor the
resistance found in it by the hand. The color, the
resistance, are, for him, in the object: they are not states
of our mind; they are part and parcel of an existence really
independent of our own. For common sense, then, the object
exists in itself, and, on the other hand, the object is, in
itself, pictorial, as we perceive it: image it is, but
a self-existing image. (from *Matter and Memory*, p. 10,
Zone books): 

<!--Perhaps obvious that from the inside the inside cannot
be told, like being in a cave. But how do we get from
inside to outside to tell it. Strengthen sense in which
the inside seems sufficient. And what distinguishes
the outside in which we are always outside ourselves,
from the outside in which we are always inside ourselves?
Also, in below, perhaps make explicit the inference
from awareness to being outside ourselves more generally.
-->

What Bergson attributes here to common sense, we can take to
be what awareness is like from inside it. And from the
inside, awareness is nothing but openness. The way things
seem is the way things are, as if we saw them from *no*
point of view, and were outside ourselves as a matter of
course. And to suspect otherwise; to think we are never
outside ourselves wholly; to suppose we always see things
from a point of view; to doubt that the way things seem is
ever the way things are---this is what awareness is like
from outside it, or from what Bergson attributes here to the
speculations of philosophy. From the outside, then,
awareness is always enclosed in openness. And if our
selfhood is what encloses it, then we have a way to sharpen
our paradox to a kind of point: for we could say it is only
from outside ourselves that we can see ourselves enclosed;
only from outside ourselves that we come to see the self we
are always inside of; the self that makes being outside
ourselves questionable, and even impossible: a contradiction
in terms. But if it *is* a contradiction in terms, then how
did we get outside ourselves to see it, and why is that not
enough to contradict the contradiction? 

<!--Note, this stretch should be connected to previous
part, in that we are not open to self and other at once.-->

In other words, what distinguishes the outside within, where
we are always outside ourselves, and nothing but openness,
from the outside without, where we are always inside
ourselves, and enclosed in openness? And how are we ever
carried from the one outside to the other? (Note: should
make this the true sense of openness.) If the way things
seem is the way things are, from within awareness, then how
do we ever escape awareness, as if from a cave, to see, with
self-awareness, that the way things seem is *not* the way
they are? If common-sense, as Bergson describes this, is
adequate enough to make astonishing the speculations of
philosophy against that adequacy, then how do these
speculations ever arise, much less become convincing? What
makes philosophy possible? What makes wonder possible? What
makes openness possible?
