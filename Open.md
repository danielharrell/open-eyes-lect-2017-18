My lecture tonight is in three parts.

# Part One {#one}

We use the word "open" in ways that range from the prosaic
to the profound:

    - "I can't get the jar open."
    - "When does the store open?"
    - "The window is open."
    - "He's an open book." 
    - "She greeted them with open arms."
    - "My door is always open."
    - "Keep an open mind."
    - "Open your heart."
    - "My eyes were finally opened."

But why does the word have such scope? This is one reason
for wonder.

Another reason is that we use the word, typically,
without further ado, as if its meaning were already
understood. But if so, then how is it understood?
And is there something here not understood? Or better
understood? The difference between a door and an open door
may be like the difference between Socrates and Socrates
sitting. For only a philosopher, according to Aristotle,
would care about this difference.[^Socrates.] But the
philosopher in all of us, then, can wonder about that
difference. We can wonder what it means to say "my door is
always open"---even if asking this of a friend, who just
said it to you, risks being rude. Or dense. The way we use
the word "open" without further thought may make it worth
further thought.

Still another reason for wonder comes from the way we
define the word "open" in dictionaries---largely through
negation. To be open means *not* to be closed. Or blocked.
Or covered. Or fastened. Or sealed. Or buttoned. Or guarded.
Or protected. Or folded. Or clenched. Or concealed. Or
constipated.[^Dictionary] This may be definition enough for
everyday use. But what about those deeper moments of speech,
when we talk of eyes being opened? Or arms? Or minds? Or hearts?
Or again the proverbial door, always open to a friend?
Here we use the word "open" for a positive
condition, a state of being, which any negative definition
at best half-comprehends. And to ask about the meaning of
"open", then, is to ask about the meaning of hospitality,
generosity, compassion, love.

Nor are these the only such states of being. Think of how we
say our eyes are open, merely to mean we are awake. But why say
this of our eyes, and not our eyelids, which we might call
"open" more literally? To use the word for our eyes may be
figurative; but it captures how we seem to see *through* our
eyes, to a whole world outside us. <!-- This reaching out should be
used in a transition paragraph later.-->  To ask about the
meaning of "open", then, is to ask about the meaning of
wakefulness, watchfulness, awareness. It is to ask about a
way of being that may well be *our* way of
being: the one underneath all the others; the one that 
explains *why* we use the word with such scope, and as if it
were already understood.

Awareness might also explain our reliance on
negation to define the word. For in one sense,
a negative sense, being open in awareness means being
*not* ourselves, so far as we are aware of anything else.
<!--Later come back to this idea involving negation, where
we are transformed by awareness into a kind of invisibility.
THis relates to way in which world is *other* to us--> But
negation here seems especially half-comprehending.
For beneath our awareness of anything else is an
awareness we have of ourselves. <!-- Later connect this
point, perhaps, to Adam and Eve and nakedness: the price of
knowledge is the shame of nakedness.--> And this gives the
word "open" a deeper sense of positive scope, as it
comprehends self and other at once, and captures something
that our times of solitude and solicitude have in common.

In this vein, too, the word "open" might have a home in any
community that conceives itself as a community of learning,
and believes, without the blush of contradiction, that
learning best happens among others, yet only happens in
oneself. And if no one else can do your learning for you,
it might take a word like "open" to explain why you don't
find yourself alone at this college, but among others around
a table, face-to-face. To ask about the meaning of "open",
then, is to ask about the meaning of this. The meaning of
us. Just as we can ask, as we look at the cover of the St.
John's viewbook, why the word "open" might be enough to
introduce us. <!--Later refer back to this last sentence,
in trying to rehabilite positive question after arguing
againts its possibility. Something like: does this
impossibility mean that we are guilty of false advertising
on the cover of the St. John's viewbook?-->

[Back to top](#top)



# Part Two {#two}

In all these ways, the word "open" gives us much to wonder
about. But there is another way, I want to suggest, in
which the word gives us just one thing to wonder about.
<!--Later shift: the word gives us the only thing to wonder
about. For wonder depends on being open, and is perhaps
the deepest mark of its possibility.-->
And this is by analogy, borrowing from Aristotle again, to
the one thing we can wonder about when we encounter, as if
for the first time, wooden figures come to life; or the
sun reverse course one day in the sky; or the diagonal of
a square escape measure by any part of its side, no matter
how small.[^AristotleWonder.] The wonder, in each case,
is how such a thing is possible. <!--Later point out that
this isn't really possible, on a certain philosophical
explanation--> Once we learn how, we can give what we
encounter a name, like "marionette", or "solstice", or
"incommensurable." But these can become words we inherit
rather than originate, and discourage understanding just as
much as display it, as we use the name for what we don't
yet know as if we do. <!--Later return to this: Aristotle
says we end in opposite state from wonder, which suggests
a kind of negation of world in which wonder began, or an
understanding of world that leaves no place for wonder; just
like Aristotle's account of nous. Another way to describe
this: how the cause of wonder ends up being located in the
realm of appearance, to be dispelled by an account of the
reality. Then can move on to Phaedo.--> <!--Another thought:
In moving from an appearance of openness to its denial in
reality, we are thinking philosophically, yet common life
continues to embrace openness. Could use the Bergson quote
here. Then quote from other others to show the ambivalence
of philosophy.-->

The word "open", I suspect, is just such a name. Behind it,
or beneath it, lies a problem, a paradox, to make us wonder
how being open is possible. <!--Later, in transition, point
out that we started perhaps in the attempt to explain how
openness is possible, only to argue that it isn't possible,
or that its an appearance rather than a reality. This is
what philosophical reflection does. (Don't forget Bergson
here.) --> But to wonder how is also unlikely, since we have
the word "open" to prove its possibility. If, for example,
I say "I can't get the jar open", I will look for a better
grip on the lid, not the word. But even here, I can wonder
about the word. For why get a better grip on the lid to open
the jar? Suppose I decide not to bother with the lid, and
simply throw the jar to the ground, breaking it open. Why is
this not simply another way of opening the jar? Why say
instead that I *broke* the jar open?

We say this, it seems, in wanting the jar to remain a jar:
something opened *without* being broken. More abstractly put:
we want the word "open" to mean that the barrier between
the jar's inside and outside has been removed, without the
difference between inside and outside being erased. Or still
more abstractly: we want the word "open" to mean that there
is continuity, yet at the same time discontinuity, between
inside and outside.

But here, then, is the paradox. For how can there be
continuity and discontinuity at once? In this case, how is
the jar's inside still inside, and not outside, as soon as
the lid is removed? If we leave the jar open, its contents
may spoil---as if for nature, even if not for us, a lidless
jar has no inside, and can only gain one by being closed.
In what sense, then, can I truly open the jar, no matter
how great my grip on the lid?

This is one way to wonder how being open is possible.
But not the only way. And other ways need make no appeal to nature,
or ruin, if an inside is left open to the outside too
long. Consider a line from geometry: the parabola.
We can distinguish the sides of this line, one convex and
one concave, since the parabola is curved. But suppose we
go further, and take the convex side to be inside the
parabola, and the concave side to be outside. This would
treat the curved line as a figure, analogous to the ellipse,
only open rather than closed. We might even liken this
figure to an lidless, empty jar. But what would justify this
interpretation? Why think that the parabola *has* an inside,
distinct from, but open to, an outside? Why aren't both
sides of the parabola outside it, since both lie outside the
line of the parabola?

To answer this question in defense of the interpretation, we
can make the inside of the parabola definite, by completing
the analogy to the ellipse. We would then take the parabola
to be an infinite ellipse, with one focus infinitely far
away. The parabolic line would then be infinite in length,
with ends that reach the edge, as it were, of the geometric
plane. But in that case, it seems, our parabola will gain a
true inside in just the way our jar possessed one: by being
closed. For there will be no way into the parabola, or out
of it, through its open end, since this now lies infinitely
far away. Or to put the paradox in this case more sharply:
once we make the line of the parabola infinite, to make the
inside of the parabola definite, we will have *enclosed* the
parabola in openness. And this enclosure will make the
openness of the parabola at once intelligible yet
impassable. The way this figure stays open on one side will
be something we can plainly see, even point to, yet never
reach---as if openness had no being but seeming.

This, then, is another way to wonder how being open is
possible. <!--Note later that we wonder this by giving
arguments for its impossibility; and philosophy rests here,
in impossibility. In mere appearance, then go back to
examples from Aristotle, then Bergson.--> And while it might
seem contrived, in coming from mathematics, it suggests
a more general way, and radical way, to wonder how being
open is possible. For what if every way of being open were
like the parabola? That is, what if every way of being open
were really a way of being closed that merely looked open?
What if we ourselves were enclosed in openness?

We can put this last question in more plausible terms. What
if our very selfhood enclosed us in openness? For the self
poses its own paradox of openness, and perhaps its own
resolution in closedness. Consider the power of awareness,
which again might be the openness most our own,
comprehending self and other at once. But how? How can I be
self and other at once? In spatial terms, we might say that
I am carried outside myself, in my awareness of anything
else; yet also kept inside myself, since this awareness is
mine, and known as mine through self-awareness. But how can
awareness put me inside and outside at once? Or carry me
from one to the other, as if the two were continuous, yet
keep me in one rather than the other, as if the two were
discontinuous? How can I be carried outside myself without
losing myself, making openness impossible? Or kept inside
myself without closing myself, again making openness
impossible? The only way, perhaps, is if the self can bring
the outside inside, in something like the way a jar
is closed, or a parabola completed. That is,
perhaps only if the self encloses what lies outside it, can
the self be open to what lies outside it.

This suggestion about our selfhood may sound abstruse, or at
least abstract. But we have a commonplace expression to
clarify the suggestion, and make it more concrete, when we
speak of having *a point of view*. Here at the podium, for
example, my awareness gives me a point of view on you in the
audience. And this explains why I can be aware of you
without becoming you, or at least find myself sitting beside
you in the audience. For it seems I remain just where I am,
and what I am, at the point of my point of view. And my
awareness of you, or of anything else, strictly changes
nothing in either my place or my identity. We might admit
that the very idea of a point of view comes with a paradox
of its own: for how can a view belong to a point? That is,
how can a whole with many parts belong to that which has no
part? But if we were pressed this way, on the coherence of
a point of view, we might think of a geometric figure by
analogy, even more enclosed than the parabola. For what if
a point of view were like the center of a circumference? In
that case, my awareness of you would not mean that I became
you, or reached you, but instead that I encompassed you. And
in that sense, it seems, I would *contain* you in my point
of view, as if my openness to you were a matter of enclosing you;
and as if we were both, more generally, enclosed in
openness, much like a parabola, and perhaps even more like
a circle. 

If anything, the force of this idea is lost in familiarity.
But to make it less familiar, think again of those deeper
moments of speech, where we speak of openness---whether of
eyes, or arms, or mind, or heart--as if it were a state of
being. We can think in turn of rarer moments in life that
justify such speech, where we might want to say that
something *can* change, or *has* changed, in our place or
identity. We could think of these as moments of otherness
that most reveal our openness. Still, it seems easier to
suppose that such moments have done something *to* our point
of view---moved it, altered it, enlarged it, deepened
it---than to suppose they have more simply erased it, or
denied it, or refuted the very idea of it. In other words,
it is easier to suppose that the self might be
transformed, than to suppose that the self could ever be
transcended. But why should this be easier, unless the self
stayed intact enough, or closed enough, to make the
otherness in openness seem a property of self rather than
a negation of self? 

We can find still more support for this idea in the merest
philosophical reflection. For in this context, the merest
such reflection might be that our point of view *is* a point
of view. And if we recognize this, it becomes possible to
question our point of view, or doubt it, or even want to
overcome it, as if we might someday see things from *no*
point of view. See them, that is, as they truly are; as they
are in themselves; as they are *outside* any point of view,
no matter how encompassing. But the backdrop of this
reflection would seem to be the recognition that a point
of view is precisely what we can never escape. For how could
we see at all, without a point of view?  Or ever see beyond
it, if seeing any distance requires it? And a large part of
deeper philosophical reflection might well be reduced to
this recognition. For what more, really, is contained in the
self-knowledge of Socratic ignorance? Or the self-certainty
of Cartesian doubt? The transcendental self of Kantian
critique? Or the absolute self of Hegelian dialectic? It can
start to seem as if there is nothing at the end of
philosophical reflection but a self to embrace, since it can
never be transcended. 

Nor do we need the arguments of philosophy to reach this
conclusion. And other ways of reaching it can even allow for
the semblance of self-transcendence. Consider this passage,
from perhaps the greatest novel in English:

> (797) Rosamond, taken hold of by an emotion stronger than
her own---hurried along in a new movement which gave all things
some new, awful, undefined aspect---could find no words,
but involuntarily she put her lips to Dorothea's forehead
which was very near her, and then for a minute the two women
clasped each other as if they had been in a shipwreck.

Readers of *Middlemarch* may remember this moment. For Eliot
leads us to it from a depiction, in the character of
Rosamond Vincy, of a self that seems incapable of such
a moment: the moment when a life of self-regard reaches
a point of self-release. But this point of self-release, as
Eliot describes it, is in the shipwrecked embrace of another
self, as if there were nothing outside self but self, making
transcendence, in turn, a movement from self to self.

Nor is this the only such moment in the novel. The
other self in the passage above, Dorothea Brooke, is lead
to a similar point, in her unhappy first marriage to
Mr. Causabon. Here is how Eliot accounts for it:

> We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world
as an udder to feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early
begun to emerge from that stupidity, but yet it had been
easier to her to imagine how she would devote herself to Mr.
Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his strength and
wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is no
longer reflection but feeling---an idea wrought back to the
directness of sense, like the solidity of objects--that he
had an equivalent centre of self, whence the lights and
shadows must always fall with a certain difference.

On this account, what Dorothea must learn is not that she
married a lesser man, without the strength or wisdom to make
her wise and strong in turn; but rather that she married
another self, which makes her a self in turn, no matter how
selfless she yearns to be. Or to put the lesson another way:
to transcend the self altogether is not simply impossible,
but illusory, since a desire for this can blind one to the
selfhood in others that makes for true transcendence in
recognition, not renunciation. 

Or to put the lesson one last way: to be open to another, or
to anything other, means regarding it as *more* than other.
But this seems to mean regarding it from a point of view at
which the other is a self, or at least related
to self. That is, it means seeing what is other from
a center at which its otherness can be encompassed by the
self. Or contained. Or enclosed. Which again would mean that
being open, in the end, is a way of being closed, despite
the look otherwise. Or more simply put: being open, truly
and simply open, is impossible. 

# Part Three {#three}

But *is* it impossible? There is yet another passage in
*Middlemarch*, I think, to help us raise this question
anew, and renew our wonder at the word
"open". 

> “For my part I am very sorry for him. It is an uneasy lot
at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to
enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and
never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering
self—never to be fully possessed by the glory we behold,
never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into
the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the
energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and
uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and
dim-sighted.

The subject of this passage, of course, is Edward Causabon.
And Eliot addresses the reader directly, I think, to
persuade us, if not to love Causabon, at least to
acknowledge him, and come to know him, then, as self rather
than other, just as Dorothea must learn to do. It is as if
Eliot wants to *open* us to Causabon, to undergo our own
movement of transcendence, from reader to character, as she
gives us a point of view on Causabon to make him pitiable
rather than contemptible. That is, Eliot gives us a center
from which another can be seen as self, and as if to move us
from self to self, in the only form of self-transcendence
possible, if again our selfhood encloses us in openness. 

But what is it, then, that makes Mr. Causabon pitiable? For
Eliot writes as if he should be pitied for a self he can
never escape, and as if there were no way to enjoy and still
be enclosed. For what selfhood is left once we are
possessed, fully, by the glory we behold? Or once our
consciousness is transformed, rapturously, into the
vividness of a thought? The ardor of a passion? The energy
of an action? Eliot writes of enjoyment as if it were an
experience not of satisfaction, but of consummation.
A liberation from the self in need, intelligibly enough; but
where what remains in deliverance, more puzzlingly, is not
the self fulfilled, or even a self at all, but only the
fulfillment itself, with nothing left to fill. 

The puzzle in this, of a self transcended altogether, can
make it easy to doubt Eliot's description of enjoyment. We
might accuse it of falsely making what we feel into what we
are, when there is no escape from what we are, even in the
most ecstatic feeling of joy. Once the feeling is gone, we
can presume, it will leave us with a self in need, as if our
liberation in joy were just a dream. Yet Eliot writes her
description not to make joy look exceptional, but to make
the man who lacks it look exceptional. And if we are to pity
him, it seems we must take the self-transcendence in joy
that Causabon has never known to be true rather than false.
A matter of fact rather than a matter for doubt. But this
confronts us with another paradox. For how can we take
a matter *as* fact, if it is easy to doubt? That is, how can
we *read* what Eliot writes about self-transcendence as she
intends it, if it is possible to *doubt* what she writes as
she intends it? One answer is that what Eliot
writes about self-transcendence can be questioned outside
the novel, even if it goes unquestioned inside the
novel. But this answer only sharpens the paradox. For why is
it only outside the novel, and outside ourselves as readers
of the novel, that a description of being outside ourselves
becomes questionable?

Nor do we need a novel to pose the paradox. Consider the
following passage, from a book of philosophy by Henri
Bergson:  

>It would greatly astonish a man unaware of the speculations
of philosophy if we told him that the object before him,
which he sees and touches, exists only in his mind and for
his mind or even, more generally, exists only for mind, as
Berkeley held. Such a man would always maintain that the
object exists independently of the consciousness which
perceives it. But, on the other hand, we should astonish him
quite as much by telling him that the object is entirely
different from that which is perceived in it, that it has
neither the color ascribed to it by the eye nor the
resistance found in it by the hand. The color, the
resistance, are, for him, in the object: they are not states
of our mind; they are part and parcel of an existence really
independent of our own. For common sense, then, the object
exists in itself, and, on the other hand, the object is, in
itself, pictorial, as we perceive it: image it is, but
a self-existing image. (from *Matter and Memory*, p. 10,
Zone books): 

<!--Perhaps obvious that from the inside the inside cannot
be told, like being in a cave. But how do we get from
inside to outside to tell it. Strengthen sense in which
the inside seems sufficient. And what distinguishes
the outside in which we are always outside ourselves,
from the outside in which we are always inside ourselves?
Also, in below, perhaps make explicit the inference
from awareness to being outside ourselves more generally.
-->

What Bergson attributes here to common sense, we can take to
be what awareness is like from inside it. And from the
inside, awareness is nothing but openness. The way things
seem is the way things are, as if we saw them from *no*
point of view, and were outside ourselves as a matter of
course. And to suspect otherwise; to think we are never
outside ourselves wholly; to suppose we always see things
from a point of view; to doubt that the way things seem is
ever the way things are---this is what awareness is like
from outside it, or from what Bergson attributes here to the
speculations of philosophy. While awareness is nothing but
openness from the inside, from the outside, awareness is
always enclosed in openness. And if our selfhood is what
encloses it, then we can put the point again paradoxically,
but even more paradoxically than before. For why is it only
outside ourselves that being outside ourselves becomes not
just questionable, but impossible? That is, why is it only
outside ourselves that we come to see the self we are always
inside of; the self that makes being outside ourselves
a contradiction in terms? 

And if it is a contradiction in terms, then how did we get
outside ourselves to see it, and why is that not enough to
contradict the contradiction? What distinguishes the outside
within, where we are always outside ourselves, and nothing
but openness, from the outside without, where we are always
inside ourselves, and enclosed in openness? And how are we
ever carried from the one outside to the other? If the way
things seem is the way things are, from within awareness,
then how do we ever escape awareness to see, with
self-awareness, that the way things seem is *not* the way
they are? Or to put the question in terms from Bergson
himself, if common-sense is adequate enough to make the
speculations of philosophy against that adequacy
astonishing, then how do these speculations ever arise, much
less become convincing? Or to put the question one last
way, in Platonic terms: if inside ourselves we
are nothing but openness, and in that sense possess 
an interior whose interiority we never see, as if
we inhabited a cave, then how do we ever get outside
ourselves to (revise this paragraph) we live in a cave invisible to
us from within, openness seems to define
our lives from within, then how can we liberate ourselvesour lifeooked at from within ourselves
is nothing but openness, 


then how Or to put the question in terms
borrowed from Bergson himself: then what distinguishes the outside
how do we get outside ourselves to see it? Given the
adequacy of common sense, where the way things seem is the
way things are, what makes philosophical speculation from
within, kOr to put this in Bergson's terms, what makes
philosophical speculation possible, if common sense against
common sense even possible, if common sense What makes the
contradiction manifest?

how we get outside ourselves to see it, and see it as
indeed a contradiction, and why not consider
our getting outside ourselves to see it sufficient to
resolve it? What makes philosophical
speculation possible, given the completeness of common sense?  is only outside ourselves
that we can see this, then why does it look like a contradiction
rather than a fact? is the contradiction affirmed

to be is *this* the contradiction

- This is a description of awareness as openness.

- Bergson: within awareness, how things seem is how
they are, as if we saw things from no point of view. (Look
at earlier passage to echo this.)

Now move to another way to transcend self (Kant, Hegel, maybe
Hume, then Eliot) in respect to other selves.
Things in themselves vs things for us, how things are vs how
they seem, difference between things being seen, and things
being done, between being affected by the world, and being active
in the world.  What is to be done? (Bulstrode most dramatic
example?) No reconciliation of selves between Dorothea and Causabon,
and he asserts his egoism from beyond the grave.)

and casts being open in doubt; use this frame to spell out
how the self encloses us in openness.) The paradox in this
made us puzzled how a jar could be open, or a parabola. So
why be any less puzzled how we can be open? And if we can
resolve the paradox by closing the jar or parabola, why not
follow suit for the self, and suppose that it, too, encloses
us in openness? Why not suppose, for example, that my
awareness of you carries me outside myself by keeping me
inside that outside, in an awareness of you that is mine,
awareness carries me outside myself, us outside ourselves by
keeping us inside that outside, as if there were no outside
for self save one that the self can encompass, and somehow
make its own?  

Suppose you see me at the podium: you have gone outside yourself,
but insofar as this is your perspective, you have made it your
own. Or suppose you use this perspective as a reason to think
you know nothing, or doubt everything. This is still self-knowledge,
or self-certainty. Negation of everything leaves the self intact.
Affirmation of everything builds upon the self. Make a kind of
science out of seeming: in Kant and Hegel. You may claim
you see things as they are, but it is only as they seem, and you
can doubt this, or claim not to know it, or build an entire edifice
on seeming (a la Kant). doubt that
you see things as they are, or to claim, with Socrates, that you
know nothing. Suppose you marry a man (use this rhetoric to get to
other texts and transcendence of self.) Suppose you are woken from
your dogmatic slumbers.

Hegel mocks idea of sneaking up on things in themselves from
behind. He mentions, but only to mock. Only way to absolute is
through the self, not around the solf.

Philosophy "great outdoors" entangled in science: Meillassoux's
arche-fossil a sign of this.

Reasons to suppose my lecture is done, with part two.
that is,
by locating us inside a self that can encompass that outside,
and make it in some sense one's own.   inside
a swithin
a selfgiving us no
way to escape it even when we seem to transcend it. our very
selfhood does enclose us in openness, that what I fI could
only be led outside myself and remain a self if the self
econceive it in terms that enclose us in openness.
, consider it the way that we, too, are enclosed in
openness?

doubt that
a jar could be open. puzzled how a jar could be open. So why
should we be any less puzzled how we can be open? just like
a jar truly open. ? . But how can I be inside myself and
outside myself at once? Or again: can lead me outside
myself, while still locating me inside me me inside myself
while leading me outside myself, ? ;How can I be at the same
time inside myself yet outside myself?  as if between inside
and outside there again could be continuity and
discontinuity at once. But how? Or to make the paradox
specific: you may say you see me at the podium right now, as
if there were a line---call it the line of sight---that at
the same time connects us yet separates us, joining us along
its length, yet parting us across its length. But what kind
of line is that? 

There is still another way to put the paradox that suggests
a resolution: (put paradox now in terms of in-itself and
for-us) Then move on to the intelligibility of radical
thoughts about the world.

(More thoughts to integrate:
Necessity in tragedy is fate: a mark of the gods and
self-transcendence; by the time we reach Kant a mark
of immanence. Also: to look for enchantment in a
science fiction or fantasy novel involves a fragmented
world rather than integrated whole.) And the readiest way to
resolve this paradox is to suppose that 

 (Perhaps
include more specific paradox, along lines of jar. Then
move on to how we are "closed" like the jar, and give 
examples. The other becomes immanent, and can only
transcend us not as other, but self. (Middlemarch here.)

Paradoxes: how can we be *not* ourselves *and* ourselves at once?

Or, in terms like the jar, how can we be outside ourselves,
yet inside ourselves, at once? 

Put discontinuity and continuity here. Then move on to
"solutions". 

- More abstract formulation of our being open and how
we are enclosed: link continuity to for-us relation,
discontinuity to in-itself relation. 

- Stabs at formulation of above abstract formulation:

    - Any openness to world, to the outside in this sense,
      puts us in a relation to it: it becomes something for
      us. But how can something for us ever be something in
      itself? 

    - We seem to see things as they are, in themselves; yet
      to see them puts them in relation to us: so how can we
      ever see them as they are in themselves? We are open
      to them, so one might say, insofar as they are not us,
      but in having a relation to us, we enclose them. 

    - Where we asked why the inside is not on the outside in
      the case of the jar, we could ask why the outside is
      not on the inside in the case of eyes? 


    - Example of seen object: podium. We say "I see the
    podium". In this formulation, I am not the podium,
    and in that sense there is discontinuity, or separateness,
    independence. Yet I *see* the podium, and in that sense
    there is continuity, or relatedness, dependence.
    
    - Another formulation: insofar as I am aware of the
    podium, I am in a sense invisible to myself; but
    insofar as I am aware of myself, I am visible to myself.
    Yet how can I be visible and invisible at once? 

    - Solution: our relation to the podium encloses our our
      separateness from it, and openness to it. (This is
      true in both Kant and Hegel.) 



This is one way, a plausible way, to say what it means
to have a self: to think of the blessing, but also the burden, 
of having a self.


- To be aware makes us open, but to be self-aware
encloses us in that openness.

- Being enclosed makes possible philosophical thoughts
that we remember, and literary experiences too. How
could we claim to know we know nothing, or to doubt
everything, without being enclosed in the self?

- Refer back to self-awareness, and perhaps to eyes being
open.

- Opacity of eye: we see everything *in* space and time.
Things are universally, and necessarily, seen *in* space
and time. But there is nothing that can have these
properties insofar as we are affected by them. The
encounter on this level is particular, and contingent.

- Try to connect podium example to space and time
immediately above.

in Kantian terms: the sense in which
we see everything *in* space, is a sign of how we contain
what we see. For space to be something *in which* things
are

- Basic point: we are in a domain of immanence when it
comes to knowledge, and transcendence only in morality.


---

- First stab at paragraph after above (but see below for
  other idesa): In light of this question, consider again
  why we call our eyes open. This captures how we seem to
  see *through* them, to a whole world outside us. But
  again, this is to speak figuratively, and perhaps even
  falsely. For if our eyes were truly so open, to the point
  of transparency, then how could we make reference to them
  at all, in calling them open? They may be transparent as
  a medium of awareness, but as a matter of self-awareness,
  it would seem as if our eyes have to be opaque. Or to put
  this prospect more generally: if we are not merely aware,
  but *self*-aware, then perhaps we are indeed *enclosed* in
  openness, with no escape from the self, no matter how much
  outside the self we seem to see, or yearn to be.  

 
- Enclosed in openness: what it means to have a self,
that cannot be transcended altogether. 

- Our selfhood encloses us in openness.

    - General thought, via Kant: Necessity and universality,
      or knowledge, depends on immanence, not transcendence.
      And so far as there is transcendence, it is not of the
      self, but towards the self. 

    - This allows what we seem to be open to, the world, to
    be put into doubt.

    - This explains why what lies outside us---"the
      world"---can be put into doubt. Why we can think we
      can never reach something in itself, but only
      something for us. Why we can think we know nothing,
      and also why it seems we can doubt everything.

    - Also why what it means to transcend egoism is in
    terms of selfhood.

    - Whether we start with thought, as in Descartes, or
      start in perception, in Hume, we get no farther than
      that relatedness.

- Example of self-transcendence, but in terms of self-hood:

    - Lesser novelist than Eliot: awakening of Dorothea
      would be that she married a lesser man than she
      thought. A man who fell short of Pascal, or Milton, or
      Locke. But the real awakening is in her realizing she
      married another self, which any ideals of greatness
      risk obscuring rather than revealing. 

    - Love thy neighbor as oneself.

Hume: we know other selves, through sympathy, even if we don't know external
world.

Hume: Hume on sympathy; (2.1.11) example of the origin of impressions being explicable, since they are conversions from ideas. Their origin
is transparent, not mysterious. (Find quotes.)

My own grief may come from unknown causes, ultimately; but the
grief I feel through sympathy is comparatively transparent, on
Hume's account.

Hume: impressions of sensation arise from unknown
causes. (Treatise: 1.1.2)

Start with account of awareness, then use Kant to move to
transcendence in morality, but this too involves the self.
Kant objects conforming to subjects, turned into appearances,
leaving room for ethics (freedom) rather than causality in
thing in itself.

Eliot: Look up Rosamond's awakening, and frame Dorothea
not as realizing she was married to a lesser man than
she thought, but rather as realizing she had married
a real man, an subject rather than object of admiration,
a fellow self.

Lesson: transcending the self is in terms of the self.


---

Some quotes: 

Look at Hegel introduction for something to include
in lecture. - Thought about Hegel: we come to know, as
a moment in time. This is a way of transcending the self
on behalf of the self. We overcome distinction between
for-us and in-itself from within, rather than from
without.

Page 50 of Pluhar Critique: Kant speaking of Plato and
    wings, had no notion of not going anywhere for lack of
    a footbrace. Note that here, Kant replaces a metaphor
    of winged motion (exploring a great outdoors) with
    a metaphor of a resting place.
    
> When the light dove parts the air in free flight and
feels the air's resistance, it might come to think that
it would do much better still in space devoid of air. In
the same way *Plato* left the world of sense because it
set such narrow limits to our understanding; on the wings
of the ideas, he ventured beyond that world and into the
empty space of pure understanding. He did not notice that
with all his efforts he made no headway. He failed to make
headway because he had no resting point against which---as
a foothold, as it were---he might brace himself and apply
his forces in order to set the understanding in motion.

Kant Pluhar p. 94:
> The things that we intuit are not in themselves as we
intuit them as being. Nor do their relations in themselves
have the character that they appear to us as having. And
if we annul ourselves as subject, or even annul only the
subjective character of the senses generally, then this
entire character of objects and all their relations in
space and time---indeed, even space and time
themselves---would vanish; being appearances, they cannot
exist in themselves, but can exist only in us. What may be
the case regarding objects in themselves and apart from all
this receptivity of our sensibility remains to us entirely
unknown. All we know is the way in which we perceive them.

Kant thought: Kant: the all-encompassing marks of our
experience—necessity; universality—are the marks of things
as they stand for us, under subjective conditions of their
possibility. The horizon of this encompassment, in other
words, is the self.

- What seems correct about account of enclosed openness:
Explains an appearance as false. Self-knowledge, makes
being enclosed in openness sound goo.

* Problem with enclosed openness: 

* The outside not really outside, for self, but inside.

    - Plato & myth: intimations of what is out there to be
  known. What is in the heavens. (Homer and Plato alike,
      unlike Tolstoy.) We have lost this.

    - epic poetry vs novel, fantasy, science fiction; the
    other-worldly as genre.

    - Tragedy: puts necessity and universality in a
    transcendent domain: fate.

    - Freedom in liberal education? (Use of transparent cage
    quote) 
    
    - Reversal of end goal: move from wisdom in Olympian
       point of view to self-preoccupation

    - Problems with science:

	- Science has lock on Discovery and knowledge by
	  going out and exploring the world. Philosophy
	  armchair and naval gazing by comparison. 

	- Philosophy has lost the great outdoors and science
	  has co-opted this, even though it proceeds through
	  a vexing of nature and a trial. (Kant and Bacon).
	  Experiment vs adventure.

		- Kant quote: "Thus reason must indeed approach nature in
		order to be instructed by it; yet it must do
		so not in the capacity of a pupil who lets the
		teacher tell him whatever the teacher wants, but
		in the capacity of an appointed judge who compels
		the witnesses to answer the questions that he
		puts to them." (Pluhar p. 19)

		Point of above quote: reason must study nature according
		to its own plan, compel nature to answer its own questions.
	
Bacon quote? Nature and human power synonymous: I.III (New Organon; also
look at I.II, about "The unassisted hand and the understanding left to itself possess but little power."  "Knowledge and human power are synonymous." 

From Bacon Great Instauration: "the nature of things betrays itself more readily under the vexations of art than in its natural freedom." (From
section Arguments of Several Parts at beginning)

Perhaps use paradoxes in quantum inquiry here, how instruments
get in way of understanding. Giving answers he wants, rather than
the right answers. Technology same problem.


Homer and Tolstoy compared
Andre looks up at sky; Homer penetrates the sky.
Euclid and Lobachevski: the doubt about the fifth postulate,
the lack of figural coherence. Look up Brann discussion of
non-Euclidean geometry. Euclid sees as far as can be (like
Homer through the sky) in the fifth postulate, to know
that even the slightest inclination of one line to
another will oblige them to meet. Lobachevski, in his 
doubt about the fifth postulate, doesn't see as far.

Lobachevski: > "In the uncertainty whether the perpendicular
AE is the only line which does not meet DC, we will assume
it may be possible that there are still other lines, for
example AG, which do not cut DC, how far soever they may be
prolonged" 

Issues in quantum mechanics.

Rosamond from Middlemarch (p.779):
> What another nature felt in opposition to her own was
being burnt and bitten into her consciousness.

Homer: noon-day sun? Allanbrook.
"In his poem the sun is always high noon, and the angle of
its light is a right angle."
Allanbrook (SJC Review)
> What is seen is named specifically as what it is when it reveals itself to sight. It is not that a vase is two- handled, it's a two-handled vase; it is not that a cauldron is unfired, it is an unfired cauldron; it is not that a chest is made of cedar, it is a cedar chest. Even more clearly we never see a sword, we see a bronze sword; we never see red, we see a red fire. Direct perception is always correct, it cannot lie.
Tolstoy and Homer both writers of presentness, actuality.
Quote on Tolstoy about this? Quote for Homer about this?

Isaac Babel: "If the world could write, it would write
like Tolstoy". 

Homer seeing as it is linked to Bergson's point about
perception being pictorial.
Common life experience of openness. Philosophical arguments
against it make it less doubtful than astonishing.

What does fifth postulate do for Euclid, in terms of
completing figure. Also look at Eva Brann's bit on 
non-Euclidean geometry.

Plato: intimations of what goes unknown reaches beyond the
stars. Socratic ignorance goes hand in hand with a form
of enchantment. Now an education in disenchantment. 

Perhaps look for Schopenhauer quote on Will. Or just
summarize: selfhood establishes the "beyond": in this case
in will; in Kant's case in morality. Also mention problems
in next section: for common life, for modern philosophy,
for philosophy. 

Hume quote (Treatise, 1.2.6):

> A like reasoning will account for the idea of *external
existence*. We may observe, that 'tis universally allow'd by
philosophers, and is besides pretty obvious of itself, that
nothing is ever really present with the mind but its
perceptions or impressions and ideas, and that external
objects become known to us only by those perceptions they
occasion. To hate, to love, to think, to feel, to see; all
this is nothing but to perceive.

> Now since nothing is ever present to the mind but
perceptions, and since all ideas are deriv'd from something
antecedently present to the mind; it follows, that 'tis
impossible for us so much as to conceive or form an idea of
any thing specifically different from ideas and impressions.
Let us fix our attention out of ourselves as much as
possible: Let us chace our imagination to the heavens, or to
the utmost limits of the universe; we never really advance
a step beyond ourselves, nor can conceive any kind of
existence, but those perceptions, which have appear'd in
that narrow compass. This is the universe of the
imagination, nor have we any idea but what is there
produc'd.

Hobbes quote from *Leviathan* Chapter 1. Distinguishes
his account of sense from Aristotle:

> Yet still the object is one thing, the image or fancy is
another. So that Sense in all cases, is nothing els but
original fancy, caused (as I have said) by the pressure,
that is, by the motion, of externall things upon our
Eyes, Eares, and other organs thereunto ordained.

Socrates: Know nothing. Descartes: Doubt everything.

Descartes? Speaks only in his own name. Shuts himself off
to meditate. The self provides the horizon for everything
else, for existence outside oneself. Explain the world
not as it is, but as it might be. I think therefore I am;
thinking leads to existence. Doubting at start.

Middlemarch quotes?

Page 194-195: Causabon had not actively created any illusions
about himself.

Page 200: She was as blind to his inward troubles as
he was to hers. Page 211: She had awakened to his center
of self. Combine with 278-280.

Page 419: No speck so troublesome as the self.
425: Had not occurred to Causabon to see Dorothea like himself.
> “For my part I am very sorry for him. It is an uneasy lot
at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to
enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and
never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering
self—never to be fully possessed by the glory we behold,
never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into
the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the
energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and
uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and
dim-sighted.” 

Book II. Old and Young. Chapter 20.

> If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human
life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the
squirrel's heart beat, and we should die of that roar which
lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the quickest of
us walk about well wadded with stupidity.

On Egoism (Book III. Chapter 27. Waiting for Death.)

> An eminent philosopher among my friends, who can dignify
even your ugly furniture by lifting it into the serene light
of science, has shown me this pregnant little fact. Your
pier-glass or extensive surface of polished steel made to be
rubbed by a housemaid, will be minutely and multitudinously
scratched in all directions; but place now against it
a lighted candle as a centre of illumination, and lo! the
scratches will seem to arrange themselves in a fine series
of concentric circles round that little sun. It is
demonstrable that the scratches are going everywhere
impartially and it is only your candle which produces the
flattering illusion of a concentric arrangement, its light
falling with an exclusive optical selection. These things
are a parable. The scratches are events, and the candle is
the egoism of any person now absent-- of Miss Vincy, for
example. Rosamond had a Providence of her own who had kindly
made her more charming than other girls, and who seemed to
have arranged Fred's illness and Mr. Wrench's mistake in
order to bring her and Lydgate within effective proximity. 

Note: Bergson quote below captures sense in which open
eyes are crucial: not simply, *can* we see the world as it is? but
*do* we see it as it is? Are our eyes really open?

Also: if we do see things as they are, then what room, or place,
is there left for wonder? (Perhaps use Aristotle's question about
being remaining a question as a way forward; a question that
remains a question; an experience of wonder that never quite goes
away, or that enchants the world rather than disenchanting it.)

Bergson quote (from *Matter and Memory*, p. 10, Zone books): 

>It would greatly astonish a man unaware of the speculations
of philosophy if we told him that the object before him,
which he sees and touches, exists only in his mind and for
his mind or even, more generally, exists only for mind, as
Berkeley held. Such a man would always maintain that the
object exists independently of the consciousness which
perceives it. But, on the other hand, we should astonish him
quite as much by telling him that the object is entirely
different from that which is perceived in it, that it has
neither the color ascribed to it by the eye nor the
resistance found in it by the hand. The color, the resistance, are, for him, in the object: they are not states of
our mind; they are part and parcel of an existence really
independent of our own. For common sense, then, the object
exists in itself, and, on the other hand, the object is, in
itself, pictorial, as we perceive it: image it is, but
a self-existing image. 

a boundary on openness as impassible is bounded by the self we also see,  circumscribed by a 
boundary as impassible as the parabola. we are indeed enclosed
in openness, if our self-awareness makes them opaque,
then perhaps the world we seem to see outside us really lie
inside us? . , . transparent, how could we make reference
open, to the point of ransparenti, at the same time our open
eyes make us aware of the world, For example, we call our
eyes open, as I put this earlier, insofar as we seem to see
through them, to a whole world outside us. it might only
be in a first sense, and again a figurative sense, while
we might call our eyes open, again, insofar as we seem to
see through them, to a whole world outside usIn light of
this question, consider my earlier description of the open
eyes of awareness. - Make direct point: being enclosed in
openness is one way to characterize what it means to be not
merely aware, but *self*-aware, which imposes a boundary on
openness as impassible as the parabola.

- Perhaps borrow from earlier formulation.

- Where to put self-mastery? 

- Perhaps put Schopenhauer quote and Wolff quote here.

Schopenhauer's most famous work, *The World as Will and
Representation*, begins in a similar vein of
closedness:

> "The world is my representation": this is a truth valid
with reference to every living and knowing being, although
man alone can bring it into reflective, abstract
consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical
discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and
certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but
only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth;
that the world around him is there only as representation,
in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely
that which represents, and this is himself.[^WWR]

On this account, our open eyes are not transparent but
opaque; and the world we see through them is not outside but
inside, having a relation to us that is given rather than
gained. 

Later Schopenhauer quote about will:
> "We ask whether this world is nothing more than representation.
In that case it would inevitably pass by us like an empty dream."
"If, therefore, the material world is to be something
more than our mere representation, we must say that,
besides being the representation, and hence in itself and
of its inmost nature, it is what we find immediately in
ourselves as will." 

Read from second volume of WWR.

Wolff quote here:

- Talk of lack of self-mastery, but also of more general
drift of books, involving self-mastery. Innocence of
Freshman books, fall of Junior books. (Education in
being closed.)

- Perhaps use genesis story. Example of how the advent of
self-awareness involves a fall, where what one sees as
other than oneself, exposes oneself to others.

- Make point about recognition.

- Shorten what follows this, add example of Dorothea and
her open heart.

<!--Note, will want to come back to this formulation as a
way of anchoring this section of the lecture.--> <!--Raise
question at beginning of next section: Does the account in
last part (part two) increase wonder, or dispell wonder?
This is related to question about whether we should regard
"openness" as real or not. --><!--Later, go back to
Aristotle examples to show this same claim to mere
appearance: marionettes merely look alive; the sun merely
looks as if it reverses course; the side of a square looks
divisible enough to measure the diagonol, but needs to
straddle the even and odd to do so. A philosophical account
in Dedekind to make this too an appearance.--> In light of
this question, consider what I earlier called *states of
being*, and what it means, truly means, for your door to
be open. Or your heart. Or your mind. Or your eyes. : the open door of hospitality; the open heart of
compassion; the open mind of understanding. 

- Point to make: openness in these cases requires
self-mastery, recognition.

- Examples to use: Odysseus, Leontius, Dorothea Brooke.


Openness here
has the genuineness of a virtue. But virtue requires
cultivation, and runs the risk of corruption. And there are
examples, in the books we read, of openness gone wrong, to
make us wonder how it stays right, or true. Recall the open
door in Homer's *Odyssey*, that lets the suitors of Penelope
fill the house of Odysseus in his absence, in the abuse of
hospitality. Or the open eyes of Leontius in Plato's
*Republic*, that let the spectacle of corpses fill his gaze,
to his own contempt, in a similar abuse of
sight.[^Republic.] Or the open heart of Dorothea in Eliot's
*Middlemarch*, that let the scribblings of Both examples
suggest there are cases of openness to be condemned, where
something between inside and outside has broken. But what
could this be, if not a boundary that stays intact, in cases
of openness to be praised? Yet if the boundary stays intact,
then why are these cases of being open rather than cases of
being closed? Or rather: cases of being closed that *look*
open, and even have that look not merely, but truly, in an
appearance of openness to be praised?

We can ask this question from another direction. For suppose
the difference between true openness and mere openness were
like the difference between letting in and getting in. But
how can we distinguish letting in from getting in, save in
light of a power to keep certain things *out*, like corpses
and suitors? The power, that is, to be closed? And even if
this is also the power to be open, the exercise of it would
seem to involve a choice that encompasses what we are open
to, and in that sense encloses it, just as the parabola was
enclosed in openness. <!--Use this formulation later--> This
enclosure in the human case might be thought a boundary of
recognition, that not only excludes what we keep out, but
contains what we let in. This boundary would also be what
breaks in cases of corruption, laying us open, like a broken
jar, to whatever lies outside. 

Or to use a different image, we might say that there is a
kind of hinge in being open that works, once it breaks,
only one way: outside in. When Odysseus, then, is no longer
master of his door, it no longer opens from the
inside, to contain the outside in an act of recognition. It
only opens from the outside, and exposes
the inside to an act of transgression. Hence the suitors,
and how they indeed get into the house of Odysseus. Or the
corpses, and how *they* get into the eyes of Leontius, once
he loses his mastery of them, and can no longer open them
from within.

On this account, in any case, only mere openness could be
boundless, and by analogy to something broken, not open.
True openness is always bounded, or closed. But we can
deepen this account, to suggest that even mere openness must
be bounded, to gain any semblance of boundlessness. For now
consider our ownmost state of being, on my earlier
suggestion: the open eyes of awareness. Here, too, openness
has the genuineness of a virtue. But this is now in the
sense of a natural power, beneath any cultivated excellence,
and inclusive of any corruption that comes to light. This
inclusiveness is made dramatic in the case of Odysseus. For
while his absence allows the suitors to get into his house,
his discovery of this will prevent them from getting out.
And a door that only opens from the outside can still be
locked from the inside, to help accomplish and contain the
slaughter. Mere openness in this case seems only as
boundless as true openness finally lets it be---once we
count as true a form of recognition that can countenance
even acts of transgression, and see them, if not punish
them, for what they are.

The open eyes of awareness likewise allow us a closer look
at the open eyes of Leontius. For while his loss of mastery
over them may expose him, like a broken jar, to whatever
lies outside, this same loss allows his eyes, like an
unbroken jar, to take their fill---one might say to the
brim---of the spectacle. His boundless eyes might even be
compared to a perfect jar: one that stays intact, no matter
what it contains, or how full it gets; and with nothing for
a lid to protect, given its indifference to its contents.
This perfection of outer sight also seems matched by inner
sight. For Leontius is able to denounce his eyes, despite
his loss of command. "Look for yourselves," he exclaims,
"you evil wretches, take your fill of the beautiful sight."
His eyes remain his, despite their liberation from him.
For their becoming unbounded results not in blindness, but
sight; and not unconsciousness of the fact, but recognition
of it. To stare is still to see, and in this case to see
with an acute sense of the boundary breached in seeing.
This is another case, then, where mere openness seems only
as boundless as true openness lets it be, lest it escape
not merely the bounds of better judgment, but even those of
simple cognizance, rendering it an example of blankness
rather than openness.

And if we turn from the open eyes of Leontius to our own, we
can better see how the truth of openness might lie in
boundedness, even when its look is boundless. This boundless
look is why again we call *our eyes* open rather than our
eyelids, as we seem to see through our eyes---with no
boundary stopping us---to a whole world outside us. But this
is also again to speak figuratively. For eyes could not be
open like eyelids, or even like lidless jars---the eyes of
Leontius notwithstanding. That is, eyes could not be
boundless on the side they open. For on that side they can
be poked, injured, even blinded. Staying open for eyes seems
to mean staying intact, or bounded, all the way around. And
if eyes were open like jars nonetheless, then why should we
*see* outside us rather than suffer it in blindness? For as
we noted before, an open jar's inside risks being spoiled by
the outside. So why should the outside not pose a similar
threat to eyes that stay open? Yet in this respect, the
outside is something that our power of sight protects us
from, just as our organs of sight protect us by staying
intact. But how, in that case, can eyes be open to the
outside at all, even figuratively? Only, perhaps, if they
can contain it rather than yield to it, in an act of
comprehension rather than submission. That is, perhaps only
if our eyes enclose what they see, can they be open to what
they see. If so, then we would again find ourselves enclosed
in openness, and no different from the parabola even in
the kind of openness most our own.

But we can clarify this thought, and towards an even more
bounded geometric image of this predicament. For not only do
we seem to see outside us through open eyes; we seem to see
*a whole world* outside us. But if this is merely the
unbounded look of what is truly bounded, then how? That is,
how could something as small as our eyes *contain* something
as large as the world? Or more radically: how can a mere
part of the world *contain* the entire world? Only, perhaps,
if containment in this case were a matter of definition
rather than size, and allowed the world to be encompassed
before it has to be crossed. But in just this way, it seems,
we see without having to move to what we see. 
And we might even say that what it *means* to see is for
the world to contain, at one place or part, other places
or parts. 

. ; and can
call what we see "the world", no matter how partial or
provisional our point of view. It is as if the world does
contain, at one place or part, its other places or parts . It is as if
we were always at a kind of center for sight, and what we see
on a kind of circumference, which in its entirety is what
we *mean* by "a whole world outside us". And in this
way at least, it seems as if the world
could contain, at one place or part, its other places
or parts. (Move on to perspective from here, then underline
that language here is of a circle. Also note that
circumference looks straight if infinite)

We could even say what it *is* to see is for the
world to contain, at one place or part as center, its other
places or parts at a circumference. . Yet if the places or
parts are to remain distinct, then the one place or part The
one place or part could be thought a kind of center, and
the other places or parts And comprehension is one way to
characterize the achievement of sight. We see, after all,
without having to move to what we see, as if sight spared us
any distance to cross, by allowing us instead to encompass
it, putting us at a kind of center, and what we see on a
kind of circumference. of a circumference and what we see
at a kind of circumference. (Then expand on circumference.)
in a kind of circumference. having to cross any distance,
since it allowed us instead to encompass. werecrossed, by
sight, but rather encompassed. as if sight allowed us to
encompass distance rather than spared us having to cross
what it allowed us todistance were encompassed, not crossed
se without having to be crossed. And we might even say that
what it *means* to see is for the world to contain, at one
place or part, other places or parts. the power of sight
were a power to encompass

And perhaps *every* other place or part. For while
in one respect we see only so far, in another it seems we
see as far as can be, in the embrace of all there is to see.
We could say we see only as far as the horizon; yet every
point on this horizon is one where parallels finally meet,
as if seeing that far comprehended an infinity. And insofar
as we give the name "world" to what we see, seeing that far
seems to comprehend a totality. And it provides a kind of
frame---or again an embrace---Our point of view upon
the world may be partial, hasven if our view of
the world is always partial, it it
certainly seems to comprehend a totality: the totality
that we call "the world", even if our view of the world 
is always partial. Since this is the partiality of
a perspective, or point of view, we could say that it possesses
not simply a center, but a circumference; and the
circumference insofar
as we can call this circumference (Revise.) and on which our open eyes afford
us some perspective on, for even if
our open eyes afford us a mere perspective on the world, even if
this distance is finite, affording us a mere perspective
on the world, how could we call this the world unless
our seeing that far we saw it looks as if seeing that far still
comprehends a totality: the world that we see through
this perspective. being of the world: the world of our perspective.  And perhaps
the only way we could see that far at any finite distance
is if the world in this sense were not, in itself,
anything; but instead *a frame*---or again an embrace---of
everything: the very circumference, in other words, of what
our open eyes encompass, across any distance near or far.
The world in this sense would serve as a postulate for sight
rather than a discovery, and as if the world stood behind
our eyes rather than in front of them. 

In that case perhaps we should say we see through our
eyes not *to* the world, but *through* the world, to
everything *in* the world. For the world in this sense would
be a medium for sight rather than an object, to give any
object context rather than content. The world could still be what contains
us, but only insofar as we were embodied, or
closed. Insofar as we were aware, or open, the world instead
would be what is contained by us. 

And to this latter sense of world, this infinite
circumference possessed by the open eyes of awareness, an
open jar would bear less resemblance than the ellipse we
invoked before, to complete the parabola, and render it
a geometric image for being enclosed in openness. Or perhaps
an infinite circle would better depict this predicament,
with a circumference nowhere to be found, in the appearance
of boundlessness, because of a center everywhere to be
found, in the reality of boundedness. This center, which we
might call transcendental, would ever locate the world in
relation to us as this is given rather than gained, and
therefore already there, within our eyes, at the moment they
open, as a cause of sight rather than an effect. And our
very awareness of the world, being of the world, would
show how being open at bottom means being closed
at top, like a lidded jar, or completed parabola, or simply
a circle, with a circumference so definite that beyond it
lies nothing, and nothing then to be open to. 

# Part Three {#three}

What is more, the corpses and suitors get in to spoil what's
inside. Which suggests that true openness, even in the
case of a pickle jar, or a parabola, works inside out. 
We can call the jar "open", then, because the jar's inside can stay
inside, even when the lid is off, if we look at the jar
as if looking out of it, from the inside formed when the
lid is on. And we can call the parabola "open", similarly, because
the parabola's inside can stay inside, even when its line is
finite, if we look at the parabola as if looking out
of it, from the inside formed when the parabola's line is
infinite. And we do look at things this way, as
if we were in them, looking out of them, since this is how
we have to look, on this account, to see anything at all:
from inside the entire world out, as we open ourselves
to it from having enclosed it first. 

But on this account of awareness, then, our openness to the
world depends on having enclosed it, as if being open were
how being closed looked, when seen from within. We call
a parabola "open", then, because the way it is closed gives
it an inside we can see out of, just as we can likewise see
out of a lidless pickle jar to call it "open". The jar's
inside can stay inside when the lid is off, so long as we
still look at the jar as if looking out of it, from the
inside formed when the lid is on. And the parabola's inside
can stay inside even when its line is finite, so long as we
still look at the parabola as if looking out of it, from the
inside formed when the parabola's line is infinite. And we
are likely to look at things this way, as if we were in
them, looking out of them, since this is how we have to
look, on this account, to see anything at all: from inside
the entire world out.


<!-- Note: later I could use "inside-out" to explore
self-transcendence rather than self-containment".-->

- Move back to Aristotle account to show how this account
matches it, then to Bergson quote. But then show problem
in relation to everyday life.

---

We might argue for this as the philosopher Schopenhauer once
did: 

<!--Later return to the seeming self-evidence of this, a
matter of philosophical discernment. For Part 2 opening, the
predicament is that our very thinking that proves our
freedom instead proves our enslavement. Our very openness
proves our closedness.-->

> It is therefore the Understanding itself which has to
create the objective world; for this world cannot walk into
our brain from outside all ready cut and dried through the
senses and the openings of their organs.[^Fourfold]

On this inference, it is because our open eyes are not like
a lidless jar that the world we see comes from within rather
than without---as if there were nothing outside us to see, and
the phrase "open eyes" were figurative in being false.
Schopenhauer's most famous work, *The World as Will and
Representation*, begins in a similar vein of
closedness:

> "The world is my representation": this is a truth valid
with reference to every living and knowing being, although
man alone can bring it into reflective, abstract
consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical
discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and
certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but
only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth;
that the world around him is there only as representation,
in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely
that which represents, and this is himself.[^WWR]

On this account, our open eyes are not transparent but
opaque; and the world we see through them is not outside but
inside, having a relation to us that is given rather than
gained. 

---

---


- From here introduce enclosed in openness as separate theme
  to introduce next part. and as if we were enclosed in
  openness.

This may still sound paradoxical, even though this account
resolves the paradox in the word "open" that I described
earlier, and the continuity and disconuity ia word from
which we want both continuity and discontinuity between
inside and outside. The continuity, on this view, is found
in space, where the inside can become an outside; while the
discontinuity is found in us, where the inside remains an
inside.  The paradox that lingers, if we are enclosed in
openness, is that the inside contains the outside, might
better be called a predicament.

<!--In Wolff quote could say this replaces a paradox with
a predicament. One way to put predicament: openness is proof
of closedness, the world as it is, is not as it seems.-->

<!--"predicament" below could be tied to language of
"paradox" above if I bring back language of "paradox" for
that.-->

The sense of this predicament, of being enclosed in
openness, is captured well, I think, in this description by
Francis Wolff, a contemporary philosopher:

> Everything is inside because in order to think anything
whatsoever, it is necessary to ‘be able to be conscious of
it’, it is necessary to say it, and so we are locked up in
language or in consciousness without being able to get out.
In this sense, they have no outside. But in another sense,
they are entirely turned towards the outside; they are the
world’s window: for to be conscious is always to be
conscious of something, to speak is necessarily to speak
about something. To be conscious of the tree is to be
conscious of the tree itself, and not the idea of the tree;
to speak about the tree is not just to utter a word but to
speak about the thing. Consequently, consciousness and
language enclose the world within themselves only insofar
as, conversely, they are entirely contained by it. We are in
consciousness or language as in a transparent cage.
Everything is outside, yet it is impossible to get
out.[^Wolff]

# Part Three: Paradox explored {#three}

- In part two, when I discuss both Aristotle and Descartes
with contrasting views of place of thinker: can ask of both
is this world *the* world?

- There are, however, reasons to wonder whether this account
of openness is true.

- Tone of fact, but philosophical reflection on fact,
according to Schopenhauer. This raises question about
philosophy.

- Make this section at start about philosophical reflection:
how does openness elude it, despite the philosopher's caring
about the difference between a door and an open door?

- New transition: speak of eyes as a transparent cage, and
  then make part two the question: how do we get out? How is
  being open possible, how do we get out?

- True openness: transparency without cage; outside that is
indeed elsewhere. Also note eyes being transparent in
particular. How to understand this? 

Wolff puts this predicament in the terms and tone
of a fact. Yet it is unsettling enough, and dependent enough
on what Schopenhauer called the dawning of philosophical
discernment, to wonder about. Another contemporary
philosopher, Quentin Meillassoux, has suggested this about
the predicament:

> For it could be that contemporary philosophers have lost
the *great outdoors*, the *absolute* outside of pre-critical
thinkers: that outside which was not relative to us, and
which was given as indifferent to its own givenness to be
what it is, existing in itself regardless of whether we are
thinking of it or not; that outside which thought could
explore with the legitimate feeling of being on foreign
territory---of being entirely elsewhere.[^Meillassoux]

<!--One idea: Odyesseus as a wanderer, going outside from
inside. But not in gesture of hospitality. Perhaps put above
Meillassoux quote.-->

On this suggestion, as we might read it to counter
Schopenhauer, at the dawning of philosophical discernment
there is an embrace of openness, which is only denied, or
lost, in further development. But this introduces another
paradox. For if it is only a philosopher who would care
about the difference between a door and an open door, why
might it also be only a philosopher who would care to shut
the door for good? This second paradox leads me to part two. 


[Back to top](#top)


Bergson quote: 

> It would greatly astonish a man unaware of the
speculations of philosophy if we told him that the
object before him, which he sees and touches, exists
only in his mind and for his mind or even, more generally,
exists only for mind, as Berkeley held. Such a man would
always maintain that the object exists independently
of the consciousness which perceives it. But, on the 
other hand, we should astonish him quite as much by
telling him that the object is entirely different
from that which is perceived in it, that it has
neither the color ascribed to it by the eye nor the
resistance found in it by the hand. The color, the
resistance, are, for him, in the object: they are not
states of our mind; they are part and parcel of an
existence really independent of our own. For common
sense, then, the object exists in itself, and,
on the other hand, the object is, in itself, pictorial,
as we perceive it: image it is, but a self-existing
image.

    - Basic arc: From Aristotle to Descartes, move
    from thinking as receptivity to thinking as
    activity.

    - Note: openness indicates a threshold, from inside to
      outside, not just a continuity. (Perhaps senior oral
      stuff could go here.)

    - Perhaps threshold preserves dimensional difference.

    - Openness not merely a continuity, but a threshold
      between inside and outside. A relation between the two
      that preserves their dimensionality.

    - And how to link to presence/absence? Odyessus absent;
      Leontius no longer mastering his eyes. But how to link
      to paradox of presence and absence in cognition: the
      sense in which to be about something means not
      belonging to that something? Explore paradox in these
      terms.

    - Cutting off parabolic side equivalent to letting
      outside in: suitors; spectacles. Openness in deeper
      sense goes hand in hand with side remaining infinite.
      But how?

    - Parabola proves a kind of image of right sort of
    openness.

- But hard to know what this is. (Perhaps move from
this to Bergson.)

#### Leftovers from outline

But if this is so, if being open means being closed, then
the word "open" might make us wonder all the more. For what
would it mean to be open without being closed? Open without
qualification? Simply open? Truly open? Open? If such a thing were
possible, then how? 


- For again the way our
eyes seem open is the way we seem to see *through* them to
a whole world outside us. But what do we mean---what could
we mean---by "a whole world" in this context? What we seem
to mean is a totality, even though we strictly see only so
far, for so long, as if what we saw were never total, but
only partial. Yet suppose it is partial. That is, suppose we
only ever see a part of the world. Then how do we come to
know the rest of the world, to identify what we see as
merely a part? How else, save again by an act of
comprehension that encompasses what we see, and
allows us to use the word "world" for what we see
intelligibly. 

- Earlier formulation not working out. ---once we count as
true not simply what can be betrayed in being open, but also
what can be trusted, as every betrayal must be seen for what
it is to be what it is. , but also what can be trusted, in
being open. Betrayals of openness must be seen for what they
are to be what they are, For we could say that every
betrayal of openness must be seen for what it is to beFor
every betrayal of openness leaves a kind of mark there,
where it must be seen for what it is to be what it is, and
in that sense depends on the openness it has betrayed.

- To see this same implication from a different direction,
recall how we say our eyes are open, merely to mean we are
awake. This again captures how we seem to see *through* our
eyes to a whole world outside us---as if they were
transparent. Or boundless. As if they
provided a medium for sight rather than a boundary, and
*carried* us to what we see rather than containing it. We
call our eyes open, in short, as if they were boundless.

- Later make more point of how our eyes carry us to what
we see rather than containing it. But this is also again to
speak figuratively. And the distance between the figurative
and the literal, in this case, might well be the distance
between the boundless and the bounded. Our eyes cannot be
open, after all, just like our eyelids, or even like
a lidless jar---the eyes of Leontius notwithstanding.

- To answer this question, we might return to our partial
sense, where true openness was bounded, and try to complete
it in the same direction, where mere openness
proves just as bounded. There must be something, then, that
confines even the eyes of Leontius. And indeed, we compared
them before to unbroken jars, as the spectacle of corpses
filled them to the brim. We could say his eyes are bounded,
then, at least along their bottom and sides, so to speak.
But what about their top? For if it is here that
eyes are filled, then it is here that eyes are boundless, like a
lidless jar. Yet open eyes are not like lidless jars. They
can be poked, injured, even blinded---as if their staying
open meant staying intact, even at the top. But if they
stay intact, then how are they filled? How does anything
outside, like a corpse, get inside? It is here that our
earlier account might still provide an answer: for perhaps nothing
outside gets inside, if eyes are filled not from without,
but from within. And they would therefore enclose what they
see, whatever it might be. <!--Perhaps put infinite circle
suggestion here-->


- Yet if we now press the account in this opposite
  direction, against all bounds, we risk replacing our
  partial sense with nonsense. For suppose true openness
  *were* boundless. What then makes it definite enough to be
  something rather than nothing? ---Much less the kind of
  something with an inside, *open* to the outside? Or again,
  what makes being open possible, if this is not a way of
  being closed---that is, a way of being definite---that can
  give being open enough definition in turn, to be something
  rather than nothing, and the kind of something with an
  inside, open to the outside?

- Being open to one thing means being open to everything.
  This is predicament. (But also perhaps solution; see
  below)

- Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing
  (see below for another version of this).

- To be something is not to be anything else. So how to be
  open to everything else, without becoming nothing,
  vanishing.

- To be something is not to be anything else. But this
  means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything
  else.

- Santayana on necessity of being closed

	> Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the
	  condition for existing at all, for having
	  a vocation, and for establishing an interest,
	  even formal and unconscious, by which to
	  distinguish life from death, benefit from
	  injury.

- Santayana on how being closed also means being open?

	- Implication of openness in existence

	    > Santayana RB page 282: "That a thing by its
	    internal being should have reference to
	    something external ... is so far from being an
	    anomaly or an exception that it is the
	    indispensable condition for existing at all."

	- Openness from page 617 Santayana: 
	
	    > ”But such a selection cannot be made
	    beforehand. In exploring you cannot first decide
	    what you shall discover; you must explore
	    everything that offers, and then perhaps select
	    the part that it concerns you to study."

- Being open: something fateful in the advent of perception
  that makes it all or nothing. (Contra Kant. See Santayana
  quote just above.)

- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world
  distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps
  necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of
  form requires the world for support, but also puts it at
  risk, requiring it to be seen.

- Inside bounded while outside unbounded

- Page 54, FFR Schopenhauer: “Consequently, the
  understanding had first to create the objective world
  itself. It cannot, however, stroll into our head
  ready-made through the senses and the openings of their
  organs.”

- Openness more than stimulus: a closed system is capable of
  being moved and moving in return. In openness there is
  a sense of allowing the outside to come in. (Or of going
  out?). But how can the outside come in without destroying
  the inside.
Mr. Honeycutt went to market.
- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that
  distinction between inside and outside is not just
  dimensional but Ontological.

## Notes for section on space

<!--To be explained: why the world
inside us appears outside us. 
It appears outside us, especially in the
"outside" that makes sense of perception, as a phenomenal
effect of being inside it as a whole, which in turn is
explained by a sense of space being inside us.-->

<!--In below, make briefer, and clarify sense
in which we experience it outside us is not spatial,
but worldly. Form of sensibility not spatial, but
worldly (cosmic). At a center, suggesting a world.--> 

<!--Space as extensive: always on surface of globe.
Space as intensive: always at center of globe.-->

- The "outside" is spatial. 
- But the spatial is outside without an inside
    - We are outside in this sense
    - We are as if on the surface of a sphere
- The "outside" in this case has an inside
    - We are inside this outside
    - We are as if at the center of the sphere
    - This center is not spatial
        - We are unmoved there
    - The inside is rather worldly, or cosmic
        - For Kant, a form of sensibility that isn't spatial

- Use old version of this section to bring back space.

- Rewrite first sentence below to this effect: because
we say the world is *outside* us, we might take this to
be an experience of space. (But this won't be quite
correct.) 

<!--Note, in below
analysis, could bring out "part/whole" language more
clearly. And connect to earlier paradox in opennness:
outside and inside continuous but discontinuous in moving
between whole and part-->

<!--Perhaps put more on reaching outside from inside as a way
to explain perception in general. Only being "inside" world
can explain reaching what lies outside us in perception-->



#### Accounts of perception and Intellect another sign of problem 

- Openness, at least in the context of mind, or awareness,
  is not merely a blank receptivity but a more
  discriminating, active "letting in", akin to opening the
  door. It involves a revelation of the world rather than
  just a reception of it. This could be a way of asking the
  question: why is being open a matter of the world's being
  revealed in being received? Or why is openness a word we
  use in cognition?

- Perhaps could use Bergson account from Matter and Memory here.

- Could also use Meillassoux account as example of modern philosophy
making things closed.

- Perhaps use Bergson and Meillassoux together, as example
  of of shift from non-philosophical account to
  philosophical account, where openness shifts to
  closedness.

- Use Aristotle and Kant (and Descartes) together as ways of
  struggling with the paradox of openness. Also connect
  problem of openness with problem of understanding how
  there can be things *about* the world in the world.

	- Most radical philosopher of openness Aristotle

	- Kant: openness becomes transcendental: being
	  nowhere in one's field, a source of possibility.
	  (Heidegger)

- More on importance of “aboutness”: Aboutness of
  consciousness gives us something to live *for*, something
  to care *about*. A distance that makes alliance and
  commitment possible. Also makes sense of thoughts,
  opinions, words, and more than just additions to the
  world.

- Focus on perception and intellect, contrasting Aristotle
  and Kant, on absence and presence

- To be something is not to be anything else. But this
  means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything
  else.

- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world
  distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps
  necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of
  form requires the world for support, but also puts it at
  risk, requiring it to be seen.

- Inside bounded while outside unbounded

- Possible transition to “absence” of eyes and presence:
  Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing

- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that
  distinction between inside and outside is not just
  dimensional but Ontological.

- Shift from outside to inside a shift from extrinsic
  relations to intrinsic

- Distinction between inside and outside, is more deeply
  between intensive and extensive, and still more deeply, as
  a spiritual predicament, between the given, and
  accidental, and the ideal, and obligatory.

- World is reversed in going from outside to inside in
  perception or intellection. This is what causes the
  problem of appearance and reality.

- Little prince boa constrictor vs hat: having an inside

- To be open is to be, in a radical sense, invisible.
  Openness is absence.

##### Eyes need to be absent

- Make basic issue here the sense in which being about
  something means not belonging to something (sense in which
  eyes need to be absent)

- How can there be something in the world that is about that
  world? Something that belongs to the world not merely as
  a part of it, but as a revelation of it? (But compare to
  Santayana quote below)

- Also liken eye present or vanishing to omniscient
  narrator.

- Absence indicated in third-person narration. Presence in
  first or second.

- Third and second person narration: eye vanished and eye
  present. But what about first person narration? Third:
  narration. Second: drama. First: soliloquy. (Perhaps put
  soliloquy below in idea of containing world). 

- Perhaps mention the cuts from scene to scene in movies: we
  don’t need to ask how did we get instantly from one place
  to another.

- Mention quantum mechanics, observer not influencing what
  is observed?

- In experience, our "invisibility" reflected in an
  awareness of "objects" that precludes any corresponding
  awareness of the subjective instruments that deliver us to
  those objects.

- When we put ourselves in world, relation now to us rather
  than in itself

- Absence of eyes: Eye image reversed, two, and
  two-dimensional, and without distance. (From Schopenhauer
  Fourfold).

- Mark of eye's invisibility: we have two eyes, but they
  provide one field of objects

- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at
  first lecture. Also look at Aristotle on intellect. Also
  Benardete.

##### Eyes need to be present

- In what sense is view from nowhere indeed a view?

	- Perhaps look at Nagel: view from nowhere

- In itself of world in causality

- Hume and Kant on causality

- Santayana from RB (xiii):

	> - Perspectives are essential to animal

	> - In an animal psyche as complex and as delicately
	    organized as the human, the spirit has a wider
	    basis and comes to light in more ways and in
	    more places than we might at first suspect. *And
	    at each point where it flowers at all, it
	    flowers into something original.* The ear yields
	    one unprecedented character to the sum of
	    existence in yielding sound, and the eye another
	    unprecedented element in yielding visual light
	    and colour. The same organic machinery, in other
	    places and motions, yields the unprecedented
	    elements of pleasure and pain and all the
	    emotions. Nor is the originality of the pigments
	    the whole originality in the spiritual picture.
	    Memory lights up perspectives which in nature
	    can subsist only as dead relations between dead
	    facts; and expectation, contradiction, doubts
	    and surprise vivify the mechanism of instinct
	    and turn plodding existence into a series of
	    comedies…. We should never become poets in the
	    end had we not been essentially poets from the
	    beginning. 

- Nietzsche on perspective?

- Basic conclusion: eyes need to be both absent yet present
  for seeing to be possible. “Openness” seems to indicate
  this dialectical predicament of absence and presence.
  Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing;
  being something by being nothing else. 

- Santayana on necessity of being closed 

    > Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the
    condition for existing at all, for having a vocation,
    and for establishing an interest, even formal and
    unconscious, by which to distinguish life from death,
    benefit from injury.

- But note: Seeing things *as* they are: reduplication
  through "as" joins presence and absence of eyes.

- Eyes contain world insofar as they are invisible, but
  contained by the world insofar as they are visible.



# Part Three: Paradox resolved {#three}

[Back to top](#top)

## Revisiting of Parabola
- Parabola is infinitely open at end, leaving no room outside it. Perhaps the secret to openness.
- Openness and closedness integrated in containment or comprehension of everything
	- This in contrast to the hyperbola and its asymptotes
- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or even beyond. Containment allows this to happen somehow.

## From parabola to solution more generally:
- We are the beings who are open. (Heidegger on possibility.) 
- Being open to one thing means being open to everything, but cast this now in the form of containment rather than exposure.
- Possibly use Leibniz?
- Show solution in terms of perception and intellect.
	- Eyes present as if at a kind of circumference to the world, or field of vision, rather than within the world.
	- Perhaps we contain the world in openness as the boundary contains the circle This would also locate us in the middle, at the center of the circle.
		- Hjelmslev disc as the circle of comprehension? Does it illuminate boundary of circle?
	- Always at the center of our perceptual field
	- Openness locates what is open at a center of things in the world.
	- This goes hand in hand with sense in which we are not merely “nowhere” in seeing, nor “somewhere” within world as one among  many, but rather at the exact point in the world where we are alone. 
		- Schopenhauer quote on representation could go here.
		- Universality of consciousness/spirit: in Schopenhauer that one death means death of world
	- The same power that allows us to encompass the world also makes us individual, alone.
	- Integration of eyes missing and eyes present: being in the world ... alone.
	- The possibility of representation inverts the relation of self to world: the self is now, in a sense, responsible for the world. The world comes to be in wakefulness, and sin is found in the self. 
	- Related to sense in which we are visitors to world, and perhaps to how images are signs rather than substances.=
	- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at first lecture.
	- Openness is to a field, the "objects" are really relations. (Take music as an example).
	- Christian insight : spirit *sent* into the world. This makes spirit guiltless for the world, and deserving in sin for forgiveness 
	- Santayana RB p. 761:
		> - Spirit has been sent into the world by the very power by which the world was created; and it aspires to live, and to find a good and beautiful world to live in. etc. (Note that here S. says that apart from accidents spirit in us is identical with spirit everywhere, a divine witness, a divine sufferer, immortal, and only temporarily and involuntarily incarnate in a myriad distracted lives.
	- The given has an ideal character: this is how it can contain the world
	-  RB Santayana p. 633:
		> - Matter would never have evolved into animals, had not organization been potential in it from the beginning; and organization would never have awakened consciousness had not essence and truth overarched existence from all eternity, and summed it up, with all its perspectives ready, for spirit to perceive."


## Possible link to light
- Could openness finally be light?
- Try to incorporate necessity of light in the idea of eyes being open
- Light connecting absence and presence of eyes: allows us to see, but also to be seen
- Light connects the present eye and the absent eye.
- Power of sight and invisibility: Gyges in Herodotus
- Try to write account of why openness is somehow like light
	- Invisibility in openness like that of the burning wick, eclipsed by the glow it produces. Perhaps explains how eye disappears?
	- Open a curtain: suggests that openness has something to do with light

## Other thoughts to bring into lecture
- Basic form of extrinsicness, time, means existence, and sense of existence, is temporal.
- Not sure what I meant with above thought. Perhaps this is way to clarify division of inside from outside. Our sense of what lies outside us, as extrinsic, involves time. But our domain of awareness makes the extrinsic intrinsic, with a corresponding removal from the flux of time into an idea, or image, that is atemporal. Perhaps could spell this out.
- PS to Brendan message: my own thinking about this is centered on the following idea: existence is what makes otherwise purely intrinsic relations extrinsic. The difference between the painting of a landscape and the real landscape it's a painting of, for example, would be that in the painting, the relation of ground to sky is internal to the painting; there is an important sense in which the ground is not outside the sky (or vice versa) as elements of the painting. But in the real, or existing landscape, the ground *is* outside the sky. And this is what it means for it to be real or existing, and not just an image in a frame.
- Try to connect this to the field of perception as being unframed. Elements are outside one another. Perhaps this sense of extrinsicness is a sense of an infinite totality unbounded. A perspective does not have “sharp” boundaries. 
- Existence takes what would otherwise be intrinsic in relation and makes it extrinsic.
- Perhaps include discussion of "literacy" and liberal arts in discussion of perception. Perception as a way not of seeing the world, but of reading the world. Then move from symbolic in this sense to example in music, and Bach in particular. Perhaps this relates to idea of “things” in awareness as symbols.
- Look at Augustine 8.5

# Conclusion {#conclude}

[Back to top](#top)

## Leftovers
- The word "open" also transcends grammar: verb (transitive and intransitive), adverb, adjective
	- He opened the door
	- The door opened slowly
	- The door is open
	- The open door distracted him
	- The door swung open

### Parabola:

Geometric example of being closed: a figure.

    - Euclid definition of figure: I.14: 

        > A figure is that which is contained by 
        any boundary or boundaries.

	- Note that "that which is contained" indicates an
	  inside or interior.

    - First example of figure in Euclid: circle

	> A circle is a plane figure contained by one line
	such that all the straight lines falling upon it
	from one point among those lying within the figure
	equal one another.

- Apollonian complication of figure:

    - A plane introduced into a cone produces conic sections.
    The circle is one, as is the ellipse. But the parabola
    and hyperbola are also produced, and they seem to be lines,
    strictly speaking, rather than figures.

* Imagine a parabola whose line continues, in either
direction, without end.

    - Is parabola a line or a figure? As a conic
    section the answer is ambiguous: the ellipse
    is closed, and hence a figure; but the cutting
    plane's continuous tilt eventually yields the
    parabola, the first open figure, which is thus
    a line.

    - Geometric terms already show an issue: figures
    are closed, so a parabola becomes a line, even
    though it is a figure.

- Image of openness but actually closed

- No way to go from outside to inside

- Openness a bridge between inside and outside, but how?

- Is the parabola really open? In the way the circle was?
  Push this paradox. How does one get from outside to inside
  the parabola?

- Perhaps use Apollonius Book II or Pascal as illustrations

	- In Pascal connection drawn between parabola and
	  a circle missing only a point. (Could this be used
	  later?)

	- Mathematical image of openness:

		- Circle with a point missing being an
		  ellipse, where the missing point becomes
		  an infinite expanse, transcending the
		  cone, produced by a "rotation" of the
		  cutting plane in a different direction, or
		  dimension, from the direction of the cone.

- Parabola: being open means being infinite. Being finite
  means being closed.

- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from
  outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or
  even beyond, but how is this possible?

# Leftovers/Stuff to work in

For being outside us means being in space. 

We could elaborate on this through an argument borrowed from
Kant. <!--Perhaps mention distinction between every part of
space outside every other part being still in space.--> For
take our experience of the world, so far as it *seems* to
lie outside us, to be an experience of space. In this sense,
whatever we see as outside us is in a place, that we might
reach by movement to that place, and more generally move
from place to place, as if the world outside us were built
part by part. But *to see* it is already to have reached it
in another sense; a sense not explained by its place outside
us, or the movement that might reach it, or movement more
generally from place to place. But this suggests that if the
world can be seen at all, even as outside us, then it cannot
be *simply* outside us, or merely built part by part. There
must be a sense, a sense tied to sense, in which the world
forms a whole inside us. Or to put this another way, which
might make the thought more intelligible, the world we see
lies outside us in a form of extensiveness, with parts
always lying outside each other; but the world we see also
lies inside us in a form of intensiveness, with no parts
lying outside each other. where  any part is indeed
*outside* any other part, sofar as we could call it
*extensive*, where its parts always lie *outside* one
another, one part always lies outside we can only see the
world *as outside* us in seeing it as *extensive*


- Explain meaning of "outside" as part-by-part. 
    - Perhaps could use category of extensive here
    - Mode of extension and medium of motion.
    - We can move from part to part, or place to place
    - Every part of space outside every other part
    - Can also move to what we see.
        - This is perhaps best illustration of outside,
	that what we see "outside" we can reach in
	movement.

- Transition to "inside" as whole
    - How to reach what we see in sight, rather than
    in movement? 
    - Since every part of space outside every other part,
    and insofar as all parts can be occupied in turn, how
    is every part *in* space? 
    - Or, how do we find the world *always* outside us, as
    a matter of perception? 

- Explain meaning of "inside" as whole
    - Every part of space *in* space.
    - Perhaps use category of intensive here.
    - Form of sensibility.

- Idea: it is only when we are inside space as a whole
that space as a whole can also be outside.
    - Problem  with this formulation: was introduced by a 
    distinction between inside as a whole and outside
    part-by-part. How to retain "part-by-part" element in
    talking about the world being outside us.

(Need to clarify this by starting with sense of outside.)
Yet space forms both a kind of outside for us, part by part;
and a kind of inside for us, as a whole. For on the one
hand, we distinguish one part of space as *outside* another,
and can occupy both parts in turn, in a motion from place to
place. Yet on the other hand, every part of space, even if
outside every other part, is still *in* space, just as we
occupy any part of it not merely *at* that place, but *in*
it, and move not merely *across* space, but *through* it. 

And while this account runs contrary to appearances, perhaps
it can then explain the appearances. For example, why does
the world appear outside us? Or more exactly, what do we
mean by *the world* when we say it appears outside us? For
we might have said as much of a friend, for example, who we
see walking towards us. But the friend would appear in front
of us; and vanish, so to speak, if she proved a stranger who
only resembled our friend. The world, by contrast, seems to
surround us, and survives any mistake about what it is.
Indeed, the world may be most apparent to us when we wonder
what it is. Where the friend appears outside us, then, as an
object, the world appears outside us as something more like
a horizon. Or we might say that the friend is revealed
through her appearance, while the world is encompassed by
its appearance. 

But what explains this difference? What makes the world's
appearance outside us different from the friend's? A first
answer might be that we are *in* the world, and therefore
always surrounded by it. But this leaves the word "world"
for what surrounds us unexplained. For we use the word, we
might say, to surround in speech what surrounds us in fact.
So how are we able to do this? Or when we say the world
appears outside us, we are able to put what surrounds us in
front of us, as if it were an object. So how are we able to
do this? And we can do this, evidently, even if, or
especially if, we wonder whether the world as it is, is
anything like the world as it seems. But if the world is
nothing like it seems, then how does it seem to be anything
at all? How does a world beyond appearance become one, even
to call it "a world beyond appearance"? And where do we find the
source of its appearance outside us, even granting a reality
outside us?

But what would it mean to look inside us for an answer, that
makes this appearance explicable? On this account, it would
mean recognizing a relation we have to the world that is
given rather than gained. Or to put this now another way: it
would mean that the world's appearance to us, no matter how
far the world could be contained in appearance, no matter
how far from this its reality, if this containment came from
within the appearance, like a circumference produced by a
compass. Or put still another way: we can call what appears
outside us *the world*, if the world in this sense is
encompassed by the appearance rather than revealed through
it, and thus forms a horizon rather than an object. Or to
try a final formulation, in more conventional philosophical
language: the world can appear outside us, if the outside
is not just a mode of extension, or medium of motion, but a
form of sensibility.
