# Introduction {#intro}

<!--
Try to incorporate the "Open" viewbook
-->

The word "open" is used
in ways that range from the prosaic to the profound. 

    - "I can't get the jar open." 
    - "When does the store open?"
    - "The window is open."
    - "He's an open book." 
    - "My door is always open."
    - "Keep an open mind."
    - "Open your heart."
    - "My eyes were finally opened."

This, then, is one reason to wonder, for
*why* does the word have such scope?

Another reason to wonder is that the word is
usually used without further explanation, as if its
meaning were already understood. But if so, then *how* is it
understood?

   <!-- Note here: I could use the St. John's viewbook to
   illustrate this: "Open", alone on the cover, is not just
   an imperative to open the book, but has a nominative
   power of suggestion as well.-->

And is there something here *not* understood, or
better understood? For who if not the philosopher, Aristotle
once asked, would care about the difference between Socrates
and Socrates sitting?[^Socrates] Or between a door and an
*open* door?---so we could add. The way we use "open"
without further thought may make it worth further thought.
And while it would be rude to ask a friend what he meant
when he told you his door is *always* open, well, what *did*
he mean? 

   <!-- In my further revision of  this part, I will
   introduce philosophy in relation to the paradox. Then go
   on to show how philosophy in a sense turns on itself in
   a denial of openness.-->

Still another reason to wonder comes from the way the word
"open" is defined in dictionaries---largely through
negation. To be open means *not* to be closed. Or blocked.
Or covered. Or fastened. Or sealed. Or buttoned. Or guarded.
Or protected. Or folded. Or clenched. Or concealed. Or
constipated.[^Dictionary] This may be definition enough  for
everyday use. But what about those deeper moments of speech,
when we talk of *eyes* being opened, or hearts, or minds, or
again the proverbial door, always open to a friend? Here, it
seems, we use the word "open" for a positive condition,
a state of being, which any negative definition at best only
half-comprehends. And to ask about the meaning of "open",
then, is to ask about the meaning of hospitality,
generosity, enlightenment, love. 

Nor are these the only such states of being. Think of how we
say our eyes are open, to mean we are awake. But why say
this of our eyes, and not our eyelids, which we might call
"open" more literally? Calling *our eyes* "open" may be
figurative, but it captures how we seem to see *through* our
eyes, to a whole world beyond---as if our eyes *were* open,
even transparent. To ask about the meaning of "open", then,
is to ask about the meaning of wakefulness, alertness,
awareness. And awareness may not be just one way of being,
but *our* way of being: the one that
underlies all the others; the one that explains *why* we use
"open" with such great scope, and as if it were
already understood.

It might also explain our reliance on negation---if
accounting for awareness could only be done indirectly,
through a kind of negation. For how can we catch our open
eyes in speech, save to say that they are *not* closed, in
being open; and *not* what they see, in being eyes. Yet if
there were nothing more to say, then how would being open
be anything at all? Something rather than nothing?  

Or to ask this question in the form that will guide me in my
lecture tonight: how is being open possible? 

[Back to top](#top)

# Part One {#one}

If we take this question seriously, then just about every
case of being open can seem like a case of being
closed. To start with a simple case, suppose I say "I can't
get the jar open"---about a stubborn jar of pickles. What
would it mean *to get* the jar opened? 

A first answer, a dictionary answer, might be: to get the
lid off.  

But why the lid? Suppose I decide not to bother with the
lid, and throw the jar to the ground, breaking it open. Why
is this not simply another way of opening the jar? Why would
we want to say instead that I *broke* the jar open? 

We would want to say this, it seems, in wanting the
jar to remain a jar: something opened without being broken.
More abstractly put: we would want the word
"opened" to mean that the barrier between the jar's inside
and outside has been removed, without the difference between
inside and outside being erased. Or still more abstractly:
we would want the word "open" to mean that there is continuity,
yet at the same time distinctness, or discontinuity, between
inside and outside.

But here, then, is reason for doubt. For how can there be
continuity and discontinuity at once? In this case, how is
the jar's inside still inside, and not outside, once the lid
is removed? After all, if we leave the jar open, the pickles
will spoil---as if the jar's inside *were* outside, and
there were no difference between an open jar and a broken
jar; no difference, that is, between inside and outside,
once the barrier between them is gone. It would be easy
enough to close the jar, but impossible to open it.    

---

As a second example, at the other end of a pickle jar,
consider a line from geometry: [the
parabola](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tlziqt2g1dkmwbi/parabola_ex.png?dl=0).
We can readily distinguish the sides of this line, one
convex and one concave, since the parabola is curved. But
suppose we go further, and take the convex side to be
"inside" the parabola, and the concave side to be "outside,"
as if the line formed a figure, analogous to the ellipse,
only open rather than closed. What would justify this
interpretation? Why aren't both sides still outside the
parabola, since both lie outside the line of the parabola?
To make the inside of the parabola definite, and press the
analogy to the ellipse, we could take the parabola as an
infinite ellipse, formed of a line infinite in length, with
ends that reach the edge of the geometric plane. But then
our parabola will gain a true inside in just the way our
pickle jar possessed one---when it was closed. For there
will be no way into the parabola, or out of the parabola,
through its open end, since this now lies infinitely far
away. The line of the parabola never closes upon itself,
true, but also never stops. Its open end, then, is
something we can plainly see, but never reach, as if openness
had no being but seeming.

---

And this seeming can start to look illusory, once
we turn to our own ways of being open, and might make deeper
sense of them as ways of being closed. For example, while we
speak of open doors and open eyes as if these were virtues,
we could also speak of them as vices. Recall the open door
in Homer's *Odyssey*, that allows the suitors of Penelope to
fill the house of Odysseus in his absence, in the *abuse* of
hospitality. Or the open eyes of Leontius in Plato's
*Republic*, that allow the spectacle of corpses to fill his
gaze, to his own contempt, in a similar abuse of sight.[^3]
Both examples suggest there are cases of openness to be
condemned, where something between inside and outside has
been broken. So what is it that remains intact, in cases of
openness to be praised? And if intact, then 
why call these cases of being open, rather than cases of
being closed?  

To press the question, we might turn next, and again, to the
way our eyes are open more generally, if figuratively, as we
see *through* them, to a whole world beyond. Yet our eyes
are not then open like eyelids, or a lidless jar, just
letting the world in. For open eyes can be poked, injured,
even blinded. Yet if our eyes are *not* like a lidless jar,
then how *does* the world get in? It could not be the way
the world gets into a pickle jar, to *spoil* what's inside.
For the world gets into our eyes, we might say, to *fill*
what's inside, as if our eyes *contained* the world it was
open to, in order to see it and not merely suffer it. But if
our eyes somehow do contain the world, then *does* the world
get in? What if our world-containing eyes were more like
a closed jar, or completed* parabola, where the world never
gets in, since it is somehow already there? We might argue
for this as the philosopher Schopenhauer once did, when he
wrote: 
 
> It is therefore the Understanding
itself which has to create the objective world; for this
world cannot walk into our brain from outside all ready cut
and dried through the senses and the openings of their
organs.[^4]

On this inference, the way our eyes are *not* like
a lidless jar makes the world we see something produced
rather than revealed---as if there were nothing outside us
to see, and the phrase "open eyes" were figurative in being
false. Schopenhauer's most famous work, *The World as
Will and Representation*, begins in a similar vein, treating
our open eyes as opaque rather than transparent, and the world we
see as if it were inside us: 

> "The world is my representation": this is a truth valid
with reference to every living and knowing being, although
man alone can bring it into reflective, abstract
consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical
discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and
certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but
only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth;
that the world around him is there only as representation,
in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely
that which represents, and this is himself.[^6]

On this line of thought, where the world around us is only there
as representation, what we experience as outside
us can only *be* experienced at all, so far as it lies inside us,
in a relation to us that is given rather than gained. This
may seem to replace a puzzle about being open with
a puzzle about being closed. For if the world does lie
inside us, insofar as we experience it at all, then why do
we experience it as outside us? 

But here we could borrow a line of thought from Kant, to
whom Schopenhauer was indebted. For take our experience of
the world to be like our experience of space. On the one
hand, we distinguish one part of space as *outside* another,
and can occupy both parts in turn. And in this respect,
space forms a kind of outside for us, as we move from place
to place. On the other hand, space forms a kind of
inside for us, despite our movement from place to place. For
every part of space, even if outside every other part, is
still *in* space for us, just as we occupy a part not merely
*at* that place, but *in* it; and just as we move not merely
*across* space, but *through* it. But why? Where does our
sense of being *inside* space as a whole come from, if we
are always *outside* every unoccupied part, and *outside*
even the occupied part, so soon as we move to another
part?

The answer, on this line of thought at least, is that our
sense of being inside space as a whole comes from us. That
is, we have a sense of space that contains not just us, but
all of space, to locate us *inside* it. And thanks to our
all-encompassing sense of space, every part of it is *in*
space for us, even though every part is also *outside* every
other part. We find ourselves inside space, then, insofar as
space is not just a mode of extension, or a medium of
mobility, but a form of sensibility---to borrow Kant's term
for it. 

So perhaps we experience the world that way: outside us, but
*because* it lies inside us. For we would never find it
outside us, on this view, unless we possessed a sense of the
world that contained it, a sense of it that is
all-encompassing. And if this inside sense of world were
ever lost, then also lost, perhaps, would be any sense of
outside---at least so far as it might be reached from
inside. Once Odysseus, for example, is no longer master of
his door, we could say a world of hospitality is lost; and
now his door can only open outside in, to let the suitors
push through. Or once Leontius is no longer master of his eyes,
we could say a world of discernment is lost; and now his
eyes can only open outside in: to let the corpses push through.   

<!-- Note: later I could use "inside-out" to explore
self-transcendence rather than self-containment".-->

But how, then, is being open possible on this account? It is
only possible by being closed. Our own ways of being
open are really ways of being closed
that look open, and give that look to anything we call
"open." It is as if we were *enclosed* in openness:
a predicament captured well, I think, in this description by
Francis Wolff, a contemporary philosopher:

> Everything is inside because in order to think anything
whatsoever, it is necessary to ‘be able to be conscious of
it’, it is necessary to say it, and so we are locked up in
language or in consciousness without being able to get out.
In this sense, they have no outside. But in another sense,
they are entirely turned towards the outside; they are the
world’s window: for to be conscious is always to be
conscious of something, to speak is necessarily to speak
about something. To be conscious of the tree is to be
conscious of the tree itself, and not the idea of the tree;
to speak about the tree is not just to utter a word but to
speak about the thing. Consequently, consciousness and
language enclose the world within themselves only insofar
as, conversely, they are entirely contained by it. We are in
consciousness or language as in a transparent cage.
Everything is outside, yet it is impossible to get out.[^7]

# Part Two: Paradox explored {#two}

- There are, however, reasons to wonder whether this account
of openness is true.

- Tone of fact, but philosophical reflection on fact,
according to Schopenhauer. This raises question about
philosophy.

- Make this section at start about philosophical reflection:
how does openness elude it, despite the philosopher's caring
about the difference between a door and an open door?

- New transition: speak of eyes as a transparent cage,
and then make part two the question: how do we get out? 
How is being open possible, how do we get out? 

- True openness: transparency without cage; outside that is
indeed elsewhere. How to understand this? 

Wolff puts this predicament in the terms and tone
of a fact. Yet it is unsettling enough, and dependent enough
on what Schopenhauer called the dawning of philosophical
discernment, to wonder about. Another contemporary
philosopher, Quentin Meillassoux, has suggested this about
the predicament:

> For it could be that contemporary philosophers have lost
the *great outdoors*, the *absolute* outside of pre-critical
thinkers: that outside which was not relative to us, and
which was given as indifferent to its own givenness to be
what it is, existing in itself regardless of whether we are
thinking of it or not; that outside which thought could
explore with the legitimate feeling of being on foreign
territory---of being entirely elsewhere.[^Meillassoux]

<!--One idea: Odyesseus as a wanderer, going outside from
inside. But not in gesture of hospitality. Perhaps put above
Meillassoux quote.-->

On this suggestion, as we might read it to counter
Schopenhauer, at the dawning of philosophical discernment
there is an embrace of openness, which is only denied, or
lost, in further development. But this introduces another
paradox. For if it is only a philosopher who would care
about the difference between a door and an *open* door, why
might it also be only a philosopher who would care to shut
the door for good? This second paradox leads me to part two. 


[Back to top](#top)


Bergson quote: 

> It would greatly astonish a man unaware of the
speculations of philosophy if we told him that the
object before him, which he sees and touches, exists
only in his mind and for his mind or even, more generally,
exists only for mind, as Berkeley held. Such a man would
always maintain that the object exists independently
of the consciousness which perceives it. But, on the 
other hand, we should astonish him quite as much by
telling him that the object is entirely different
from that which is perceived in it, that it has
neither the color ascribed to it by the eye nor the
resistance found in it by the hand. The color, the
resistance, are, for him, in the object: they are not
states of our mind; they are part and parcel of an
existence really independent of our own. For common
sense, then, the object exists in itself, and,
on the other hand, the object is, in itself, pictorial,
as we perceive it: image it is, but a self-existing
image.

    - Basic arc: From Aristotle to Descartes, move
    from thinking as receptivity to thinking as
    activity.

    - Note: openness indicates a threshold, from inside to
      outside, not just a continuity. (Perhaps senior oral
      stuff could go here.)

    - Perhaps threshold preserves dimensional difference.

    - Openness not merely a continuity, but a threshold
      between inside and outside. A relation between the two
      that preserves their dimensionality.

    - And how to link to presence/absence? Odyessus absent;
      Leontius no longer mastering his eyes. But how to link
      to paradox of presence and absence in cognition: the
      sense in which to be about something means not
      belonging to that something? Explore paradox in these
      terms.

    - Cutting off parabolic side equivalent to letting
      outside in: suitors; spectacles. Openness in deeper
      sense goes hand in hand with side remaining infinite.
      But how?

    - Parabola proves a kind of image of right sort of
    openness.

- But hard to know what this is. (Perhaps move from
this to Bergson.)

#### Leftovers from outline

- Being open to one thing means being open to everything.
  This is predicament. (But also perhaps solution; see
  below)

- Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing
  (see below for another version of this).

- To be something is not to be anything else. So how to be
  open to everything else, without becoming nothing,
  vanishing.

- To be something is not to be anything else. But this
  means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything
  else.

- Santayana on necessity of being closed

	> - Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the
	    condition for existing at all, for having
	    a vocation, and for establishing an interest,
	    even formal and unconscious, by which to
	    distinguish life from death, benefit from
	    injury.

- Santayana on how being closed also means being open?

	- Implication of openness in existence

	    > Santayana RB page 282: "That a thing by its
	    internal being should have reference to
	    something external ... is so far from being an
	    anomaly or an exception that it is the
	    indispensable condition for existing at all."

	- Openness from page 617 Santayana: 
	
	    > ”But such a selection cannot be made
	    beforehand. In exploring you cannot first decide
	    what you shall discover; you must explore
	    everything that offers, and then perhaps select
	    the part that it concerns you to study."

- Being open: something fateful in the advent of perception
  that makes it all or nothing. (Contra Kant. See Santayana
  quote just above.)

- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world
  distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps
  necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of
  form requires the world for support, but also puts it at
  risk, requiring it to be seen.

- Inside bounded while outside unbounded

- Page 54, FFR Schopenhauer: “Consequently, the
  understanding had first to create the objective world
  itself. It cannot, however, stroll into our head
  ready-made through the senses and the openings of their
  organs.”

- Openness more than stimulus: a closed system is capable of
  being moved and moving in return. In openness there is
  a sense of allowing the outside to come in. (Or of going
  out?). But how can the outside come in without destroying
  the inside.

- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that
  distinction between inside and outside is not just
  dimensional but Ontological.

#### Accounts of perception and Intellect another sign of problem 

- Openness, at least in the context of mind, or awareness,
  is not merely a blank receptivity but a more
  discriminating, active "letting in", akin to opening the
  door. It involves a revelation of the world rather than
  just a reception of it. This could be a way of asking the
  question: why is being open a matter of the world's being
  revealed in being received? Or why is openness a word we
  use in cognition?

- Perhaps could use Bergson account from Matter and Memory here.

- Could also use Meillassoux account as example of modern philosophy
making things closed.

- Perhaps use Bergson and Meillassoux together, as example
  of of shift from non-philosophical account to
  philosophical account, where openness shifts to
  closedness.

- Use Aristotle and Kant (and Descartes) together as ways of
  struggling with the paradox of openness. Also connect
  problem of openness with problem of understanding how
  there can be things *about* the world in the world.

	- Most radical philosopher of openness Aristotle

	- Kant: openness becomes transcendental: being
	  nowhere in one's field, a source of possibility.
	  (Heidegger)

- More on importance of “aboutness”: Aboutness of
  consciousness gives us something to live *for*, something
  to care *about*. A distance that makes alliance and
  commitment possible. Also makes sense of thoughts,
  opinions, words, and more than just additions to the
  world.

- Focus on perception and intellect, contrasting Aristotle
  and Kant, on absence and presence

- To be something is not to be anything else. But this
  means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything
  else.

- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world
  distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps
  necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of
  form requires the world for support, but also puts it at
  risk, requiring it to be seen.

- Inside bounded while outside unbounded

- Possible transition to “absence” of eyes and presence:
  Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing

- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that
  distinction between inside and outside is not just
  dimensional but Ontological.

- Shift from outside to inside a shift from extrinsic
  relations to intrinsic

- Distinction between inside and outside, is more deeply
  between intensive and extensive, and still more deeply, as
  a spiritual predicament, between the given, and
  accidental, and the ideal, and obligatory.

- World is reversed in going from outside to inside in
  perception or intellection. This is what causes the
  problem of appearance and reality.

- Little prince boa constrictor vs hat: having an inside

- To be open is to be, in a radical sense, invisible.
  Openness is absence.

##### Eyes need to be absent

- Make basic issue here the sense in which being about
  something means not belonging to something (sense in which
  eyes need to be absent)

- How can there be something in the world that is about that
  world? Something that belongs to the world not merely as
  a part of it, but as a revelation of it? (But compare to
  Santayana quote below)

- Also liken eye present or vanishing to omniscient
  narrator.

- Absence indicated in third-person narration. Presence in
  first or second.

- Third and second person narration: eye vanished and eye
  present. But what about first person narration? Third:
  narration. Second: drama. First: soliloquy. (Perhaps put
  soliloquy below in idea of containing world). 

- Perhaps mention the cuts from scene to scene in movies: we
  don’t need to ask how did we get instantly from one place
  to another.

- Mention quantum mechanics, observer not influencing what
  is observed?

- In experience, our "invisibility" reflected in an
  awareness of "objects" that precludes any corresponding
  awareness of the subjective instruments that deliver us to
  those objects.

- When we put ourselves in world, relation now to us rather
  than in itself

- Absence of eyes: Eye image reversed, two, and
  two-dimensional, and without distance. (From Schopenhauer
  Fourfold).

- Mark of eye's invisibility: we have two eyes, but they
  provide one field of objects

- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at
  first lecture. Also look at Aristotle on intellect. Also
  Benardete.

##### Eyes need to be present

- In what sense is view from nowhere indeed a view?

	- Perhaps look at Nagel: view from nowhere

- In itself of world in causality

- Hume and Kant on causality

- Santayana from RB (xiii):

	> - Perspectives are essential to animal
	    apprehension; an observer, himself a part of the
	    world he observes, must have a particular
	    station in it; he cannot be equally near to
	    everything, nor internal to anything but
	    himself; of the rest he can only take views,
	    abstracted according to his sensibility and
	    foreshortened according to his interests.

- Related Santayana RB (xxx-xxxi)

	> - In an animal psyche as complex and as delicately
	    organized as the human, the spirit has a wider
	    basis and comes to light in more ways and in
	    more places than we might at first suspect. *And
	    at each point where it flowers at all, it
	    flowers into something original.* The ear yields
	    one unprecedented character to the sum of
	    existence in yielding sound, and the eye another
	    unprecedented element in yielding visual light
	    and colour. The same organic machinery, in other
	    places and motions, yields the unprecedented
	    elements of pleasure and pain and all the
	    emotions. Nor is the originality of the pigments
	    the whole originality in the spiritual picture.
	    Memory lights up perspectives which in nature
	    can subsist only as dead relations between dead
	    facts; and expectation, contradiction, doubts
	    and surprise vivify the mechanism of instinct
	    and turn plodding existence into a series of
	    comedies…. We should never become poets in the
	    end had we not been essentially poets from the
	    beginning. 

- Nietzsche on perspective?

- Basic conclusion: eyes need to be both absent yet present
  for seeing to be possible. “Openness” seems to indicate
  this dialectical predicament of absence and presence.
  Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing;
  being something by being nothing else. 

- Santayana on necessity of being closed 

    > Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the
    condition for existing at all, for having a vocation,
    and for establishing an interest, even formal and
    unconscious, by which to distinguish life from death,
    benefit from injury.

- But note: Seeing things *as* they are: reduplication
  through "as" joins presence and absence of eyes.

- Eyes contain world insofar as they are invisible, but
  contained by the world insofar as they are visible.



# Part Three: Paradox resolved {#three}

[Back to top](#top)

## Revisiting of Parabola
- Parabola is infinitely open at end, leaving no room outside it. Perhaps the secret to openness.
- Openness and closedness integrated in containment or comprehension of everything
	- This in contrast to the hyperbola and its asymptotes
- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or even beyond. Containment allows this to happen somehow.

## From parabola to solution more generally:
- We are the beings who are open. (Heidegger on possibility.) 
- Being open to one thing means being open to everything, but cast this now in the form of containment rather than exposure.
- Possibly use Leibniz?
- Show solution in terms of perception and intellect.
	- Eyes present as if at a kind of circumference to the world, or field of vision, rather than within the world.
	- Perhaps we contain the world in openness as the boundary contains the circle This would also locate us in the middle, at the center of the circle.
		- Hjelmslev disc as the circle of comprehension? Does it illuminate boundary of circle?
	- Always at the center of our perceptual field
	- Openness locates what is open at a center of things in the world.
	- This goes hand in hand with sense in which we are not merely “nowhere” in seeing, nor “somewhere” within world as one among  many, but rather at the exact point in the world where we are alone. 
		- Schopenhauer quote on representation could go here.
		- Universality of consciousness/spirit: in Schopenhauer that one death means death of world
	- The same power that allows us to encompass the world also makes us individual, alone.
	- Integration of eyes missing and eyes present: being in the world ... alone.
	- The possibility of representation inverts the relation of self to world: the self is now, in a sense, responsible for the world. The world comes to be in wakefulness, and sin is found in the self. 
	- Related to sense in which we are visitors to world, and perhaps to how images are signs rather than substances.=
	- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at first lecture.
	- Openness is to a field, the "objects" are really relations. (Take music as an example).
	- Christian insight : spirit *sent* into the world. This makes spirit guiltless for the world, and deserving in sin for forgiveness 
	- Santayana RB p. 761:
		> - Spirit has been sent into the world by the very power by which the world was created; and it aspires to live, and to find a good and beautiful world to live in. etc. (Note that here S. says that apart from accidents spirit in us is identical with spirit everywhere, a divine witness, a divine sufferer, immortal, and only temporarily and involuntarily incarnate in a myriad distracted lives.
	- The given has an ideal character: this is how it can contain the world
	-  RB Santayana p. 633:
		> - Matter would never have evolved into animals, had not organization been potential in it from the beginning; and organization would never have awakened consciousness had not essence and truth overarched existence from all eternity, and summed it up, with all its perspectives ready, for spirit to perceive."


## Possible link to light
- Could openness finally be light?
- Try to incorporate necessity of light in the idea of eyes being open
- Light connecting absence and presence of eyes: allows us to see, but also to be seen
- Light connects the present eye and the absent eye.
- Power of sight and invisibility: Gyges in Herodotus
- Try to write account of why openness is somehow like light
	- Invisibility in openness like that of the burning wick, eclipsed by the glow it produces. Perhaps explains how eye disappears?
	- Open a curtain: suggests that openness has something to do with light

## Other thoughts to bring into lecture
- Basic form of extrinsicness, time, means existence, and sense of existence, is temporal.
- Not sure what I meant with above thought. Perhaps this is way to clarify division of inside from outside. Our sense of what lies outside us, as extrinsic, involves time. But our domain of awareness makes the extrinsic intrinsic, with a corresponding removal from the flux of time into an idea, or image, that is atemporal. Perhaps could spell this out.
- PS to Brendan message: my own thinking about this is centered on the following idea: existence is what makes otherwise purely intrinsic relations extrinsic. The difference between the painting of a landscape and the real landscape it's a painting of, for example, would be that in the painting, the relation of ground to sky is internal to the painting; there is an important sense in which the ground is not outside the sky (or vice versa) as elements of the painting. But in the real, or existing landscape, the ground *is* outside the sky. And this is what it means for it to be real or existing, and not just an image in a frame.
- Try to connect this to the field of perception as being unframed. Elements are outside one another. Perhaps this sense of extrinsicness is a sense of an infinite totality unbounded. A perspective does not have “sharp” boundaries. 
- Existence takes what would otherwise be intrinsic in relation and makes it extrinsic.
- Perhaps include discussion of "literacy" and liberal arts in discussion of perception. Perception as a way not of seeing the world, but of reading the world. Then move from symbolic in this sense to example in music, and Bach in particular. Perhaps this relates to idea of “things” in awareness as symbols.
- Look at Augustine 8.5

## Leftovers
- The word "open" also transcends grammar: verb (transitive and intransitive), adverb, adjective
	- He opened the door
	- The door opened slowly
	- The door is open
	- The open door distracted him
	- The door swung open

### Parabola:

Geometric example of being closed: a figure.

    - Euclid definition of figure: I.14: 

        > A figure is that which is contained by 
        any boundary or boundaries.

	- Note that "that which is contained" indicates an
	  inside or interior.

    - First example of figure in Euclid: circle

	> A circle is a plane figure contained by one line
	such that all the straight lines falling upon it
	from one point among those lying within the figure
	equal one another.

- Apollonian complication of figure:

    - A plane introduced into a cone produces conic sections.
    The circle is one, as is the ellipse. But the parabola
    and hyperbola are also produced, and they seem to be lines,
    strictly speaking, rather than figures.

* Imagine a parabola whose line continues, in either
direction, without end.

    - Is parabola a line or a figure? As a conic
    section the answer is ambiguous: the ellipse
    is closed, and hence a figure; but the cutting
    plane's continuous tilt eventually yields the
    parabola, the first open figure, which is thus
    a line.

    - Geometric terms already show an issue: figures
    are closed, so a parabola becomes a line, even
    though it is a figure.

- Image of openness but actually closed

- No way to go from outside to inside

- Openness a bridge between inside and outside, but how?

- Is the parabola really open? In the way the circle was?
  Push this paradox. How does one get from outside to inside
  the parabola?

- Perhaps use Apollonius Book II or Pascal as illustrations

	- In Pascal connection drawn between parabola and
	  a circle missing only a point. (Could this be used
	  later?)

	- Mathematical image of openness:

		- Circle with a point missing being an
		  ellipse, where the missing point becomes
		  an infinite expanse, transcending the
		  cone, produced by a "rotation" of the
		  cutting plane in a different direction, or
		  dimension, from the direction of the cone.

- Parabola: being open means being infinite. Being finite
  means being closed.

- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from
  outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or
  even beyond, but how is this possible?

[^Socrates]: "...it is the function of the philosopher to be able
to investigate all things. For if it is not the function of
the philosopher, who is it who will inquire whether Socrates
and Socrates seated are the same thing, or whether one thing
has one contrary, or what contrariety is, or how many
meanings it has? And similarly with all other such
questions." (Book IV, Part 2, *Metaphysics*)

[^Dictionary]: See, for example, the [Merriam Webster
entry](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/open) for
"open". 

[^3]: "Leontius, the son of Aglaion, was going up from the
Piraeus along the outside of the North Wall when he saw some
corpses lying at the executioners feet. He had an appetite
to look at them but at the same time he was disgusted and
turned away. For a time he struggled with himself and
covered his face, but, finally overpowered by the appetite,
he pushed his eyes wide open and rushed towards the corpses,
saying, 'Look for yourselves, you evil wretches, take your
fill of the beautiful sight.' (*Republic*, Book IV, 439e-440a)
