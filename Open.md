# Introduction {#intro}

The word "open" is used in ways that range from the prosaic
to the profound.

    - "I can't get the jar open."
    - "When does the store open?"
    - "The window is open."
    - "He's an open book." 
    - "My door is always open."
    - "Keep an open mind."
    - "Open your heart."
    - "My eyes were finally opened."

This, then, is one reason to wonder about the word, for why
does it have such scope?

Another reason for wonder is that the word is used, mostly,
without further explanation, as if its meaning were already
understood. But if so, then how is it understood?

   <!-- Note here: I could use the St. John's viewbook to
   illustrate this: "Open", alone on the cover, is not just
   an imperative to open the book, but has a nominative
   power of suggestion as well.-->

And is there something here not understood, or better
understood? Who if not the philosopher, Aristotle once
asked, would care about the difference between Socrates and
Socrates sitting?[^Socrates] Or, so we could add, between a
door and an open door? The way we use the word "open"
without further thought may make it worth further thought.
And while it would be rude to ask a friend what he meant
when he told you his door is always open, well, what did he
mean?

   <!-- In my further revision of  this part, I will
   introduce philosophy in relation to the paradox. Then go
   on to show how philosophy in a sense turns on itself in
   a denial of openness.-->

Still another reason for wonder comes from the way the word
"open" is defined in dictionaries---largely through
negation. To be open means not to be closed. Or blocked. Or
covered. Or fastened. Or sealed. Or buttoned. Or guarded. Or
protected. Or folded. Or clenched. Or concealed. Or
constipated.[^Dictionary] This may be definition enough for
everyday use. But what about those deeper moments of speech,
when we talk of eyes being opened? Or hearts? Or minds? Or
again the proverbial door, always open to a friend? Here, it
seems, we use the word "open" for a positive condition,
a state of being, which any negative definition at best only
half-comprehends. And to ask about the meaning of "open",
then, is to ask about the meaning of hospitality,
generosity, enlightenment, love.

Nor are these the only such states of being. Think of how we
say our eyes are open, to mean we are awake. But why say
this of our eyes, and not our eyelids, which we might call
"open" more literally? Calling our eyes "open" may be
figurative, but it captures how we seem to see through our
eyes, to a whole world outside us---as if our eyes were
open, even transparent. To ask about the meaning of "open",
then, is to ask about the meaning of wakefulness, alertness,
awareness. And awareness may be not just one way of being,
but our way of being: the one that underlies all the others;
the one that explains why we use "open" with such great
scope, and as if it were already understood. <!--Note:
perhaps add sentence about how open eyes are a symbol for
awareness.-->

It might also explain our reliance on negation---if being
open in this sense meant being not ourselves, so far as we
were aware of anything else. And how can we catch our open
eyes in speech, save to say that they are not closed, in
being open; and not what they see, in being eyes? Yet if
there is nothing more to say, nothing but what being open is
not, then what makes being open something rather than
nothing?

Or to ask this question in the form that will guide me in my
lecture tonight: how is being open possible? <!-- Need to
end first section with the above question explicitly.-->

[Back to top](#top)

# Part One {#one}

If we take this question seriously, every way of being open
can start to look like a way of being closed that merely
seems open---our own way of being open most of all. But to
begin with a simpler case: suppose I say "I can't get the
jar open" about a stubborn jar of pickles. What would it
mean to get the jar opened?

A first answer, a dictionary answer, might be: to get the
lid off.

But why the lid? Suppose I decide not to bother with the
lid, and throw the jar to the ground, breaking it open. Why
is this not simply another way of opening the jar? Why say
instead that I broke the jar open?

We say this, it seems, in wanting the jar to remain a jar:
something opened without being broken. More abstractly put:
we want the word "opened" to mean that the barrier between
the jar's inside and outside has been removed, without the
difference between inside and outside being erased. Or still
more abstractly, and paradoxically: we want the word "open"
to mean that there is continuity, yet at the same time
discontinuity, between inside and outside.

Here, then, is reason for doubt. For how can there be
continuity and discontinuity at once? In this case, how is
the jar's inside still inside, and not outside, once the lid
is removed? After all, if we leave the jar open, the pickles
will spoil---as if the jar's inside were outside, and there
were no difference between an open jar and a broken jar. No
difference, that is, between inside and outside, once the
barrier between them is gone. And it starts to look easy
enough to close the jar, but impossible to open it.

---

As a second example, at the other end of a pickle jar,
consider a line from geometry: [the parabola]. We can
readily distinguish the sides of this line, one convex and
one concave, since the parabola is curved. But suppose we go
further, and take the convex side to be "inside" the
parabola, and the concave side to be "outside". This would
treat the curved line as a figure, analogous to the ellipse,
only open rather than closed. But what would justify this
interpretation? Why aren't both sides of the parabola still
outside it, since both lie outside the line of the parabola?

To make the inside of the parabola definite, and press the
analogy to the ellipse, we could take the parabola as an
infinite ellipse, formed of a line infinite in length, with
ends that reach the edge of the geometric plane. But then
our parabola will gain a true inside in just the way our
pickle jar possessed one: by being closed. For there will be
no way into the parabola, or out of it, through its open
end, since this now lies infinitely far away. And while the
line of the parabola never closes upon itself, it also never
stops. Its open end, then, is something we can plainly see,
even point to, but never reach---as if openness had no being
but seeming.

---

As a set of final examples, underneath the previous two, now
consider what I earlier called *states of being*: the open
door of hospitality; the open heart of generosity; the open
mind of enlightenment. Openness in these cases has the
genuineness of a virtue, but the kind of virtue that can be
corrupted, and cast this genuineness into doubt. Recall the
open door in Homer's *Odyssey*, that lets the suitors of
Penelope fill the house of Odysseus in his absence, in the
abuse of hospitality. Or the open eyes of Leontius in
Plato's *Republic*, that let the spectacle of corpses fill
his gaze, to his own contempt, in a similar abuse of
sight.[^Republic] Both examples suggest there are cases of
openness to be condemned, where something between outside
and inside has broken. But what is it, then, that stays
intact, in cases of openness to be praised? And if it is
intact, then why call these ways of being open, rather than
ways of being closed?

<!-- Below should stick with "stay intact" wording. Move
on to corruption.-->

To press the question, we can turn next to what I earlier
called *our own state of being* in awareness. Our eyes are
open, in this sense, as we see through them, to a whole
world outside us. But this sense is again figurative, and
perhaps even false. Our eyes could not be open, after all,
like our eyelids, or like a lidless jar, just letting the
world in. For open eyes can be poked, injured, even
blinded---as if their staying open again meant staying
intact, and in that sense closed. And how, in any case, does
the world get in? For this could not be the way the world
gets into a pickle jar, to spoil what's inside. The world
gets into our eyes, we might say, to fill what's inside. It 
as if our eyes contained the world they
were open to, in order to see it and not merely suffer it.
Yet if they contain it while also staying intact, or closed,
then it looks as if the world never gets it, being already
there. 

But if our eyes do contain the world, then does the world
get in? Or is it already there, filling our eyes from
within? We give the name "world", after all, not just to
one thing we see outside us, or one thing after another;
but to everything at once, along with anything unseen that
might lie outside us. We see the whole world, in this sense,
before we see any part of it, as if our relation to it
were given before it can be gained. Or as if the world were a
postulate for sight before it can be a discovery, and stood
behind our eyes before it can stand in front of them. And
perhaps we see through our eyes not to the world, but
through the world, to everything in the world. The world
would then be a place, or even a perspective, rather than
an object. Or the sort of object our eyes could contain, as
we see through them, to give what lies outside them context
rather than content. But under any such description, the
world would be inside us to appear outside us, as a horizon
for everything else that might appear outside us. We would
be open to the world, in other words, from having enclosed
it.

---

And if we can thus explain our way of being open as a way of
being closed, perhaps we can likewise explain every other
way. Consider how we might then explain the corruption of
openness. For if we ever lost the world inside us, on this
account, we would lose its appearance outside us, along with
any way of being open to the world from within. Once
Odysseus, for example, is no longer master of his door, we
could say a world of hospitality is lost, along with the
opening of his door from the inside. So now the suitors can
get in from the outside. Or once Leontius is no longer
master of his eyes, we could say a world of judgement is
lost, along with the opening of his eyes from the inside.
So now the corpses can get in from the outside. And what gets
broken, then, in cases of openness to be condemned, is
a kind of hinge that turns from the inside rather than outside,
when the world can stand behind it rather than in front of it,
to make being open a letting-in rather than getting-in.

This same account of openness could explain every case
of being open as a case of being closed that looks open.
But this is also to say, for cases of openness to be
praised, that the world stands behind them, not in front of
them. For on this account, again, our inherent openness to
the world depends on having enclosed it, as if being open
were how being closed looked, when seen from within. We are
given all the more reason, then, to believe that every case
of being open is a case of being closed that appears open,
and that we call "open" from this appearance. We call
a parabola "open", then, because the way it is closed gives
it an inside we can see out of, just as we can likewise see
out of a lidless pickle jar to call it "open". The jar's
inside can stay inside when the lid is off, so long as we
still look at the jar as if looking out of it, from the
inside formed when the lid is on. And the parabola's inside
can stay inside even when its line is finite, so long as we
still look at the parabola as if looking out of it, from the
inside formed when the parabola's line is infinite. And we
are likely to look at things this way, as if we were in
them, looking out of them, since this is how we have to
look, on this account, to see anything at all: from inside
the entire world out.

But on this account of awareness, then, our openness to the
world depends on having enclosed it, as if being open were
how being closed looked, when seen from within. We call
a parabola "open", then, because the way it is closed gives
it an inside we can see out of, just as we can likewise see
out of a lidless pickle jar to call it "open". The jar's
inside can stay inside when the lid is off, so long as we
still look at the jar as if looking out of it, from the
inside formed when the lid is on. And the parabola's inside
can stay inside even when its line is finite, so long as we
still look at the parabola as if looking out of it, from the
inside formed when the parabola's line is infinite. And we
are likely to look at things this way, as if we were in
them, looking out of them, since this is how we have to
look, on this account, to see anything at all: from inside
the entire world out.


<!-- Note: later I could use "inside-out" to explore
self-transcendence rather than self-containment".-->

---

We might argue for this as the philosopher Schopenhauer once
did: 

<!--Later return to the seeming self-evidence of this, a
matter of philosophical discernment. For Part 2 opening, the
predicament is that our very thinking that proves our
freedom instead proves our enslavement. Our very openness
proves our closedness.-->

> It is therefore the Understanding itself which has to
create the objective world; for this world cannot walk into
our brain from outside all ready cut and dried through the
senses and the openings of their organs.[^Fourfold]

On this inference, it is because our open eyes are not like
a lidless jar that the world we see comes from within rather
than without---as if there were nothing outside us to see, and
the phrase "open eyes" were figurative in being false.
Schopenhauer's most famous work, *The World as Will and
Representation*, begins in a similar vein of
closedness:

> "The world is my representation": this is a truth valid
with reference to every living and knowing being, although
man alone can bring it into reflective, abstract
consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical
discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and
certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but
only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth;
that the world around him is there only as representation,
in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely
that which represents, and this is himself.[^WWR]

On this account, our open eyes are not transparent but
opaque; and the world we see through them is not outside but
inside, having a relation to us that is given rather than
gained. 

---

---


- From here introduce enclosed in openness as separate theme
  to introduce next part. and as if we were enclosed in
  openness.

This may still sound paradoxical, even though this account
resolves the paradox in the word "open" that I described
earlier, and the continuity and disconuity ia word from
which we want both continuity and discontinuity between
inside and outside. The continuity, on this view, is found
in space, where the inside can become an outside; while the
discontinuity is found in us, where the inside remains an
inside.  The paradox that lingers, if we are enclosed in
openness, is that the inside contains the outside, might
better be called a predicament.

<!--In Wolff quote could say this replaces a paradox with
a predicament. One way to put predicament: openness is proof
of closedness, the world as it is, is not as it seems.-->

<!--"predicament" below could be tied to language of
"paradox" above if I bring back language of "paradox" for
that.-->

The sense of this predicament, of being enclosed in
openness, is captured well, I think, in this description by
Francis Wolff, a contemporary philosopher:

> Everything is inside because in order to think anything
whatsoever, it is necessary to ‘be able to be conscious of
it’, it is necessary to say it, and so we are locked up in
language or in consciousness without being able to get out.
In this sense, they have no outside. But in another sense,
they are entirely turned towards the outside; they are the
world’s window: for to be conscious is always to be
conscious of something, to speak is necessarily to speak
about something. To be conscious of the tree is to be
conscious of the tree itself, and not the idea of the tree;
to speak about the tree is not just to utter a word but to
speak about the thing. Consequently, consciousness and
language enclose the world within themselves only insofar
as, conversely, they are entirely contained by it. We are in
consciousness or language as in a transparent cage.
Everything is outside, yet it is impossible to get
out.[^Wolff]

# Part Two: Paradox explored {#two}

- In part two, when I discuss both Aristotle and Descartes
with contrasting views of place of thinker: can ask of both
is this world *the* world?

- There are, however, reasons to wonder whether this account
of openness is true.

- Tone of fact, but philosophical reflection on fact,
according to Schopenhauer. This raises question about
philosophy.

- Make this section at start about philosophical reflection:
how does openness elude it, despite the philosopher's caring
about the difference between a door and an open door?

- New transition: speak of eyes as a transparent cage, and
  then make part two the question: how do we get out? How is
  being open possible, how do we get out?

- True openness: transparency without cage; outside that is
indeed elsewhere. Also note eyes being transparent in
particular. How to understand this? 

Wolff puts this predicament in the terms and tone
of a fact. Yet it is unsettling enough, and dependent enough
on what Schopenhauer called the dawning of philosophical
discernment, to wonder about. Another contemporary
philosopher, Quentin Meillassoux, has suggested this about
the predicament:

> For it could be that contemporary philosophers have lost
the *great outdoors*, the *absolute* outside of pre-critical
thinkers: that outside which was not relative to us, and
which was given as indifferent to its own givenness to be
what it is, existing in itself regardless of whether we are
thinking of it or not; that outside which thought could
explore with the legitimate feeling of being on foreign
territory---of being entirely elsewhere.[^Meillassoux]

<!--One idea: Odyesseus as a wanderer, going outside from
inside. But not in gesture of hospitality. Perhaps put above
Meillassoux quote.-->

On this suggestion, as we might read it to counter
Schopenhauer, at the dawning of philosophical discernment
there is an embrace of openness, which is only denied, or
lost, in further development. But this introduces another
paradox. For if it is only a philosopher who would care
about the difference between a door and an open door, why
might it also be only a philosopher who would care to shut
the door for good? This second paradox leads me to part two. 


[Back to top](#top)


Bergson quote: 

> It would greatly astonish a man unaware of the
speculations of philosophy if we told him that the
object before him, which he sees and touches, exists
only in his mind and for his mind or even, more generally,
exists only for mind, as Berkeley held. Such a man would
always maintain that the object exists independently
of the consciousness which perceives it. But, on the 
other hand, we should astonish him quite as much by
telling him that the object is entirely different
from that which is perceived in it, that it has
neither the color ascribed to it by the eye nor the
resistance found in it by the hand. The color, the
resistance, are, for him, in the object: they are not
states of our mind; they are part and parcel of an
existence really independent of our own. For common
sense, then, the object exists in itself, and,
on the other hand, the object is, in itself, pictorial,
as we perceive it: image it is, but a self-existing
image.

    - Basic arc: From Aristotle to Descartes, move
    from thinking as receptivity to thinking as
    activity.

    - Note: openness indicates a threshold, from inside to
      outside, not just a continuity. (Perhaps senior oral
      stuff could go here.)

    - Perhaps threshold preserves dimensional difference.

    - Openness not merely a continuity, but a threshold
      between inside and outside. A relation between the two
      that preserves their dimensionality.

    - And how to link to presence/absence? Odyessus absent;
      Leontius no longer mastering his eyes. But how to link
      to paradox of presence and absence in cognition: the
      sense in which to be about something means not
      belonging to that something? Explore paradox in these
      terms.

    - Cutting off parabolic side equivalent to letting
      outside in: suitors; spectacles. Openness in deeper
      sense goes hand in hand with side remaining infinite.
      But how?

    - Parabola proves a kind of image of right sort of
    openness.

- But hard to know what this is. (Perhaps move from
this to Bergson.)

#### Leftovers from outline

- Being open to one thing means being open to everything.
  This is predicament. (But also perhaps solution; see
  below)

- Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing
  (see below for another version of this).

- To be something is not to be anything else. So how to be
  open to everything else, without becoming nothing,
  vanishing.

- To be something is not to be anything else. But this
  means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything
  else.

- Santayana on necessity of being closed

	> Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the
	  condition for existing at all, for having
	  a vocation, and for establishing an interest,
	  even formal and unconscious, by which to
	  distinguish life from death, benefit from
	  injury.

- Santayana on how being closed also means being open?

	- Implication of openness in existence

	    > Santayana RB page 282: "That a thing by its
	    internal being should have reference to
	    something external ... is so far from being an
	    anomaly or an exception that it is the
	    indispensable condition for existing at all."

	- Openness from page 617 Santayana: 
	
	    > ”But such a selection cannot be made
	    beforehand. In exploring you cannot first decide
	    what you shall discover; you must explore
	    everything that offers, and then perhaps select
	    the part that it concerns you to study."

- Being open: something fateful in the advent of perception
  that makes it all or nothing. (Contra Kant. See Santayana
  quote just above.)

- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world
  distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps
  necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of
  form requires the world for support, but also puts it at
  risk, requiring it to be seen.

- Inside bounded while outside unbounded

- Page 54, FFR Schopenhauer: “Consequently, the
  understanding had first to create the objective world
  itself. It cannot, however, stroll into our head
  ready-made through the senses and the openings of their
  organs.”

- Openness more than stimulus: a closed system is capable of
  being moved and moving in return. In openness there is
  a sense of allowing the outside to come in. (Or of going
  out?). But how can the outside come in without destroying
  the inside.
Mr. Honeycutt went to market.
- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that
  distinction between inside and outside is not just
  dimensional but Ontological.

## Notes for section on space

<!--To be explained: why the world
inside us appears outside us. 
It appears outside us, especially in the
"outside" that makes sense of perception, as a phenomenal
effect of being inside it as a whole, which in turn is
explained by a sense of space being inside us.-->

<!--In below, make briefer, and clarify sense
in which we experience it outside us is not spatial,
but worldly. Form of sensibility not spatial, but
worldly (cosmic). At a center, suggesting a world.--> 

<!--Space as extensive: always on surface of globe.
Space as intensive: always at center of globe.-->

- The "outside" is spatial. 
- But the spatial is outside without an inside
    - We are outside in this sense
    - We are as if on the surface of a sphere
- The "outside" in this case has an inside
    - We are inside this outside
    - We are as if at the center of the sphere
    - This center is not spatial
        - We are unmoved there
    - The inside is rather worldly, or cosmic
        - For Kant, a form of sensibility that isn't spatial

- Use old version of this section to bring back space.

- Rewrite first sentence below to this effect: because
we say the world is *outside* us, we might take this to
be an experience of space. (But this won't be quite
correct.) 

<!--Note, in below
analysis, could bring out "part/whole" language more
clearly. And connect to earlier paradox in opennness:
outside and inside continuous but discontinuous in moving
between whole and part-->

<!--Perhaps put more on reaching outside from inside as a way
to explain perception in general. Only being "inside" world
can explain reaching what lies outside us in perception-->



#### Accounts of perception and Intellect another sign of problem 

- Openness, at least in the context of mind, or awareness,
  is not merely a blank receptivity but a more
  discriminating, active "letting in", akin to opening the
  door. It involves a revelation of the world rather than
  just a reception of it. This could be a way of asking the
  question: why is being open a matter of the world's being
  revealed in being received? Or why is openness a word we
  use in cognition?

- Perhaps could use Bergson account from Matter and Memory here.

- Could also use Meillassoux account as example of modern philosophy
making things closed.

- Perhaps use Bergson and Meillassoux together, as example
  of of shift from non-philosophical account to
  philosophical account, where openness shifts to
  closedness.

- Use Aristotle and Kant (and Descartes) together as ways of
  struggling with the paradox of openness. Also connect
  problem of openness with problem of understanding how
  there can be things *about* the world in the world.

	- Most radical philosopher of openness Aristotle

	- Kant: openness becomes transcendental: being
	  nowhere in one's field, a source of possibility.
	  (Heidegger)

- More on importance of “aboutness”: Aboutness of
  consciousness gives us something to live *for*, something
  to care *about*. A distance that makes alliance and
  commitment possible. Also makes sense of thoughts,
  opinions, words, and more than just additions to the
  world.

- Focus on perception and intellect, contrasting Aristotle
  and Kant, on absence and presence

- To be something is not to be anything else. But this
  means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything
  else.

- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world
  distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps
  necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of
  form requires the world for support, but also puts it at
  risk, requiring it to be seen.

- Inside bounded while outside unbounded

- Possible transition to “absence” of eyes and presence:
  Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing

- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that
  distinction between inside and outside is not just
  dimensional but Ontological.

- Shift from outside to inside a shift from extrinsic
  relations to intrinsic

- Distinction between inside and outside, is more deeply
  between intensive and extensive, and still more deeply, as
  a spiritual predicament, between the given, and
  accidental, and the ideal, and obligatory.

- World is reversed in going from outside to inside in
  perception or intellection. This is what causes the
  problem of appearance and reality.

- Little prince boa constrictor vs hat: having an inside

- To be open is to be, in a radical sense, invisible.
  Openness is absence.

##### Eyes need to be absent

- Make basic issue here the sense in which being about
  something means not belonging to something (sense in which
  eyes need to be absent)

- How can there be something in the world that is about that
  world? Something that belongs to the world not merely as
  a part of it, but as a revelation of it? (But compare to
  Santayana quote below)

- Also liken eye present or vanishing to omniscient
  narrator.

- Absence indicated in third-person narration. Presence in
  first or second.

- Third and second person narration: eye vanished and eye
  present. But what about first person narration? Third:
  narration. Second: drama. First: soliloquy. (Perhaps put
  soliloquy below in idea of containing world). 

- Perhaps mention the cuts from scene to scene in movies: we
  don’t need to ask how did we get instantly from one place
  to another.

- Mention quantum mechanics, observer not influencing what
  is observed?

- In experience, our "invisibility" reflected in an
  awareness of "objects" that precludes any corresponding
  awareness of the subjective instruments that deliver us to
  those objects.

- When we put ourselves in world, relation now to us rather
  than in itself

- Absence of eyes: Eye image reversed, two, and
  two-dimensional, and without distance. (From Schopenhauer
  Fourfold).

- Mark of eye's invisibility: we have two eyes, but they
  provide one field of objects

- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at
  first lecture. Also look at Aristotle on intellect. Also
  Benardete.

##### Eyes need to be present

- In what sense is view from nowhere indeed a view?

	- Perhaps look at Nagel: view from nowhere

- In itself of world in causality

- Hume and Kant on causality

- Santayana from RB (xiii):

	> - Perspectives are essential to animal
	    apprehension; an observer, himself a part of the
	    world he observes, must have a particular
	    station in it; he cannot be equally near to
	    everything, nor internal to anything but
	    himself; of the rest he can only take views,
	    abstracted according to his sensibility and
	    foreshortened according to his interests.

- Related Santayana RB (xxx-xxxi)

	> - In an animal psyche as complex and as delicately
	    organized as the human, the spirit has a wider
	    basis and comes to light in more ways and in
	    more places than we might at first suspect. *And
	    at each point where it flowers at all, it
	    flowers into something original.* The ear yields
	    one unprecedented character to the sum of
	    existence in yielding sound, and the eye another
	    unprecedented element in yielding visual light
	    and colour. The same organic machinery, in other
	    places and motions, yields the unprecedented
	    elements of pleasure and pain and all the
	    emotions. Nor is the originality of the pigments
	    the whole originality in the spiritual picture.
	    Memory lights up perspectives which in nature
	    can subsist only as dead relations between dead
	    facts; and expectation, contradiction, doubts
	    and surprise vivify the mechanism of instinct
	    and turn plodding existence into a series of
	    comedies…. We should never become poets in the
	    end had we not been essentially poets from the
	    beginning. 

- Nietzsche on perspective?

- Basic conclusion: eyes need to be both absent yet present
  for seeing to be possible. “Openness” seems to indicate
  this dialectical predicament of absence and presence.
  Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing;
  being something by being nothing else. 

- Santayana on necessity of being closed 

    > Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the
    condition for existing at all, for having a vocation,
    and for establishing an interest, even formal and
    unconscious, by which to distinguish life from death,
    benefit from injury.

- But note: Seeing things *as* they are: reduplication
  through "as" joins presence and absence of eyes.

- Eyes contain world insofar as they are invisible, but
  contained by the world insofar as they are visible.



# Part Three: Paradox resolved {#three}

[Back to top](#top)

## Revisiting of Parabola
- Parabola is infinitely open at end, leaving no room outside it. Perhaps the secret to openness.
- Openness and closedness integrated in containment or comprehension of everything
	- This in contrast to the hyperbola and its asymptotes
- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or even beyond. Containment allows this to happen somehow.

## From parabola to solution more generally:
- We are the beings who are open. (Heidegger on possibility.) 
- Being open to one thing means being open to everything, but cast this now in the form of containment rather than exposure.
- Possibly use Leibniz?
- Show solution in terms of perception and intellect.
	- Eyes present as if at a kind of circumference to the world, or field of vision, rather than within the world.
	- Perhaps we contain the world in openness as the boundary contains the circle This would also locate us in the middle, at the center of the circle.
		- Hjelmslev disc as the circle of comprehension? Does it illuminate boundary of circle?
	- Always at the center of our perceptual field
	- Openness locates what is open at a center of things in the world.
	- This goes hand in hand with sense in which we are not merely “nowhere” in seeing, nor “somewhere” within world as one among  many, but rather at the exact point in the world where we are alone. 
		- Schopenhauer quote on representation could go here.
		- Universality of consciousness/spirit: in Schopenhauer that one death means death of world
	- The same power that allows us to encompass the world also makes us individual, alone.
	- Integration of eyes missing and eyes present: being in the world ... alone.
	- The possibility of representation inverts the relation of self to world: the self is now, in a sense, responsible for the world. The world comes to be in wakefulness, and sin is found in the self. 
	- Related to sense in which we are visitors to world, and perhaps to how images are signs rather than substances.=
	- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at first lecture.
	- Openness is to a field, the "objects" are really relations. (Take music as an example).
	- Christian insight : spirit *sent* into the world. This makes spirit guiltless for the world, and deserving in sin for forgiveness 
	- Santayana RB p. 761:
		> - Spirit has been sent into the world by the very power by which the world was created; and it aspires to live, and to find a good and beautiful world to live in. etc. (Note that here S. says that apart from accidents spirit in us is identical with spirit everywhere, a divine witness, a divine sufferer, immortal, and only temporarily and involuntarily incarnate in a myriad distracted lives.
	- The given has an ideal character: this is how it can contain the world
	-  RB Santayana p. 633:
		> - Matter would never have evolved into animals, had not organization been potential in it from the beginning; and organization would never have awakened consciousness had not essence and truth overarched existence from all eternity, and summed it up, with all its perspectives ready, for spirit to perceive."


## Possible link to light
- Could openness finally be light?
- Try to incorporate necessity of light in the idea of eyes being open
- Light connecting absence and presence of eyes: allows us to see, but also to be seen
- Light connects the present eye and the absent eye.
- Power of sight and invisibility: Gyges in Herodotus
- Try to write account of why openness is somehow like light
	- Invisibility in openness like that of the burning wick, eclipsed by the glow it produces. Perhaps explains how eye disappears?
	- Open a curtain: suggests that openness has something to do with light

## Other thoughts to bring into lecture
- Basic form of extrinsicness, time, means existence, and sense of existence, is temporal.
- Not sure what I meant with above thought. Perhaps this is way to clarify division of inside from outside. Our sense of what lies outside us, as extrinsic, involves time. But our domain of awareness makes the extrinsic intrinsic, with a corresponding removal from the flux of time into an idea, or image, that is atemporal. Perhaps could spell this out.
- PS to Brendan message: my own thinking about this is centered on the following idea: existence is what makes otherwise purely intrinsic relations extrinsic. The difference between the painting of a landscape and the real landscape it's a painting of, for example, would be that in the painting, the relation of ground to sky is internal to the painting; there is an important sense in which the ground is not outside the sky (or vice versa) as elements of the painting. But in the real, or existing landscape, the ground *is* outside the sky. And this is what it means for it to be real or existing, and not just an image in a frame.
- Try to connect this to the field of perception as being unframed. Elements are outside one another. Perhaps this sense of extrinsicness is a sense of an infinite totality unbounded. A perspective does not have “sharp” boundaries. 
- Existence takes what would otherwise be intrinsic in relation and makes it extrinsic.
- Perhaps include discussion of "literacy" and liberal arts in discussion of perception. Perception as a way not of seeing the world, but of reading the world. Then move from symbolic in this sense to example in music, and Bach in particular. Perhaps this relates to idea of “things” in awareness as symbols.
- Look at Augustine 8.5

# Conclusion {#conclude}

[Back to top](#top)

## Leftovers
- The word "open" also transcends grammar: verb (transitive and intransitive), adverb, adjective
	- He opened the door
	- The door opened slowly
	- The door is open
	- The open door distracted him
	- The door swung open

### Parabola:

Geometric example of being closed: a figure.

    - Euclid definition of figure: I.14: 

        > A figure is that which is contained by 
        any boundary or boundaries.

	- Note that "that which is contained" indicates an
	  inside or interior.

    - First example of figure in Euclid: circle

	> A circle is a plane figure contained by one line
	such that all the straight lines falling upon it
	from one point among those lying within the figure
	equal one another.

- Apollonian complication of figure:

    - A plane introduced into a cone produces conic sections.
    The circle is one, as is the ellipse. But the parabola
    and hyperbola are also produced, and they seem to be lines,
    strictly speaking, rather than figures.

* Imagine a parabola whose line continues, in either
direction, without end.

    - Is parabola a line or a figure? As a conic
    section the answer is ambiguous: the ellipse
    is closed, and hence a figure; but the cutting
    plane's continuous tilt eventually yields the
    parabola, the first open figure, which is thus
    a line.

    - Geometric terms already show an issue: figures
    are closed, so a parabola becomes a line, even
    though it is a figure.

- Image of openness but actually closed

- No way to go from outside to inside

- Openness a bridge between inside and outside, but how?

- Is the parabola really open? In the way the circle was?
  Push this paradox. How does one get from outside to inside
  the parabola?

- Perhaps use Apollonius Book II or Pascal as illustrations

	- In Pascal connection drawn between parabola and
	  a circle missing only a point. (Could this be used
	  later?)

	- Mathematical image of openness:

		- Circle with a point missing being an
		  ellipse, where the missing point becomes
		  an infinite expanse, transcending the
		  cone, produced by a "rotation" of the
		  cutting plane in a different direction, or
		  dimension, from the direction of the cone.

- Parabola: being open means being infinite. Being finite
  means being closed.

- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from
  outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or
  even beyond, but how is this possible?

# Leftovers/Stuff to work in

For being outside us means being in space. 

We could elaborate on this through an argument borrowed from
Kant. <!--Perhaps mention distinction between every part of
space outside every other part being still in space.--> For
take our experience of the world, so far as it *seems* to
lie outside us, to be an experience of space. In this sense,
whatever we see as outside us is in a place, that we might
reach by movement to that place, and more generally move
from place to place, as if the world outside us were built
part by part. But *to see* it is already to have reached it
in another sense; a sense not explained by its place outside
us, or the movement that might reach it, or movement more
generally from place to place. But this suggests that if the
world can be seen at all, even as outside us, then it cannot
be *simply* outside us, or merely built part by part. There
must be a sense, a sense tied to sense, in which the world
forms a whole inside us. Or to put this another way, which
might make the thought more intelligible, the world we see
lies outside us in a form of extensiveness, with parts
always lying outside each other; but the world we see also
lies inside us in a form of intensiveness, with no parts
lying outside each other. where  any part is indeed
*outside* any other part, sofar as we could call it
*extensive*, where its parts always lie *outside* one
another, one part always lies outside we can only see the
world *as outside* us in seeing it as *extensive*


- Explain meaning of "outside" as part-by-part. 
    - Perhaps could use category of extensive here
    - Mode of extension and medium of motion.
    - We can move from part to part, or place to place
    - Every part of space outside every other part
    - Can also move to what we see.
        - This is perhaps best illustration of outside,
	that what we see "outside" we can reach in
	movement.

- Transition to "inside" as whole
    - How to reach what we see in sight, rather than
    in movement? 
    - Since every part of space outside every other part,
    and insofar as all parts can be occupied in turn, how
    is every part *in* space? 
    - Or, how do we find the world *always* outside us, as
    a matter of perception? 

- Explain meaning of "inside" as whole
    - Every part of space *in* space.
    - Perhaps use category of intensive here.
    - Form of sensibility.

- Idea: it is only when we are inside space as a whole
that space as a whole can also be outside.
    - Problem  with this formulation: was introduced by a 
    distinction between inside as a whole and outside
    part-by-part. How to retain "part-by-part" element in
    talking about the world being outside us.

(Need to clarify this by starting with sense of outside.)
Yet space forms both a kind of outside for us, part by part;
and a kind of inside for us, as a whole. For on the one
hand, we distinguish one part of space as *outside* another,
and can occupy both parts in turn, in a motion from place to
place. Yet on the other hand, every part of space, even if
outside every other part, is still *in* space, just as we
occupy any part of it not merely *at* that place, but *in*
it, and move not merely *across* space, but *through* it. 

And while this account runs contrary to appearances, perhaps
it can then explain the appearances. For example, why does
the world appear outside us? Or more exactly, what do we
mean by *the world* when we say it appears outside us? For
we might have said as much of a friend, for example, who we
see walking towards us. But the friend would appear in front
of us; and vanish, so to speak, if she proved a stranger who
only resembled our friend. The world, by contrast, seems to
surround us, and survives any mistake about what it is.
Indeed, the world may be most apparent to us when we wonder
what it is. Where the friend appears outside us, then, as an
object, the world appears outside us as something more like
a horizon. Or we might say that the friend is revealed
through her appearance, while the world is encompassed by
its appearance. 

But what explains this difference? What makes the world's
appearance outside us different from the friend's? A first
answer might be that we are *in* the world, and therefore
always surrounded by it. But this leaves the word "world"
for what surrounds us unexplained. For we use the word, we
might say, to surround in speech what surrounds us in fact.
So how are we able to do this? Or when we say the world
appears outside us, we are able to put what surrounds us in
front of us, as if it were an object. So how are we able to
do this? And we can do this, evidently, even if, or
especially if, we wonder whether the world as it is, is
anything like the world as it seems. But if the world is
nothing like it seems, then how does it seem to be anything
at all? How does a world beyond appearance become one, even
to call it "a world beyond appearance"? And where do we find the
source of its appearance outside us, even granting a reality
outside us?

But what would it mean to look inside us for an answer, that
makes this appearance explicable? On this account, it would
mean recognizing a relation we have to the world that is
given rather than gained. Or to put this now another way: it
would mean that the world's appearance to us, no matter how
far the world could be contained in appearance, no matter
how far from this its reality, if this containment came from
within the appearance, like a circumference produced by a
compass. Or put still another way: we can call what appears
outside us *the world*, if the world in this sense is
encompassed by the appearance rather than revealed through
it, and thus forms a horizon rather than an object. Or to
try a final formulation, in more conventional philosophical
language: the world can appear outside us, if the outside
is not just a mode of extension, or medium of motion, but a
form of sensibility.
