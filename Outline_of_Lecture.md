# Introduction

## Range of usage of "open" and significance

[comment]: # Try to incorporate the "Open" viewbook

- Point: The word "open" is used in ways that range from the
  prosaic to the profound. 

	- "I can't get the jar open". 
	- "When does the store open?"
	- “The window is open.” 
	- "He's an open book". 
	- "My door is always open to you"
	- "Keep an open mind"
	- "Open your heart"
	- "My eyes were finally opened"

- The word "open" has great scope: one reason to wonder about it.

* The word is also used with such scope without further
  explanation, as if it were understood. In neither an every
  day nor a deeper, more figurative sense, does anyone wonder
  about the difference between an open door
  and a closed one. But this is another reason, indeed, to
  wonder about it.

- Suggests a philosophical inquiry: who but the philosopher
  cares about the difference between a closed door and an
  open door.

- Another reason to wonder: difference between everyday and
deeper sense, and relation to negation.

    - Every day sense: reference to tangible object, such as
      a jar, a bottle, a door or a window; and as a contrast
      to "closed". "Open" used with "closed" normally, even
      definitionally. (Open means not closed.)

	- In this normal usage, the sense of openness is had
	  by negation.

	- Also note definition of "open":

	    - Not closed or blocked up; not covered; not
	      fastened or sealed; not buttoned; not
	      constipated; unguarded; unprotected; unfolded;
	      unclenched; unconcealed. 

    - Less common but deeper sense: reference to a condition
      or state of being, such as hospitality, love, and
      enlightenment; and without a contrast to "closed", as
      if *being open*, in this sense, were a virtue in
      itself. 
		- Open door ("My door is always open")
		- Open heart
		- Open eyes
		- Open mind

    - Insofar as "open" so refers to a positive condition,
      a state of being rather than negation or privation, 
      what account are we to give of it? The negative
      definitions seem insufficient. This suggests there is
      a positive account to give, and one with implications
      for what it means to see, to love, to embrace, to
      appreciate.

## Introduction to paradox in the idea of being open

- There is also a paradox in openness, especially when
  thinking of it as a positive condition, or state of being.
  This leads to the first half of my lecture. The second
  half will be my attempt to resolve the paradox.


# Body of Lecture

## Part One: Paradox Presented

### General statement of paradox?

- Here, I need a statement about the paradox of
being closed to be determinate, yet open to be open.

    - Perhaps could use jar here.

### Parabola:

Geometric example of being closed: a figure.

    - Euclid definition of figure: I.14: 

        > A figure is that which is contained by 
        any boundary or boundaries.

	- Note that "that which is contained" indicates an
	  inside or interior.

    - First example of figure in Euclid: circle

	> A circle is a plane figure contained by one line
	such that all the straight lines falling upon it
	from one point among those lying within the figure
	equal one another.

- Apollonian complication of figure:

    - A plane introduced into a cone produces conic sections.
    The circle is one, as is the ellipse. But the parabola
    and hyperbola are also produced, and they seem to be lines,
    strictly speaking, rather than figures.

* Imagine a parabola whose line continues, in either
direction, without end.

    - Is parabola a line or a figure? As a conic
    section the answer is ambiguous: the ellipse
    is closed, and hence a figure; but the cutting
    plane's continuous tilt eventually yields the
    parabola, the first open figure, which is thus
    a line.

    - Geometric terms already show an issue: figures
    are closed, so a parabola becomes a line, even
    though it is a figure.

- Image of openness but actually closed
- No way to go from outside to inside
- Openness a bridge between inside and outside, but how?
- Is the parabola really open? In the way the circle was? Push this paradox. How does one get from outside to inside the parabola?
- Perhaps use Apollonius Book II or Pascal as illustrations
	- In Pascal connection drawn between parabola and a circle missing only a point. (Could this be used later?)
	- Mathematical image of openness:
		- Circle with a point missing being an ellipse, where the missing point becomes an infinite expanse, transcending the cone, produced by a "rotation" of the cutting plane in a different direction, or dimension, from the direction of the cone.
- Parabola: being open means being infinite. Being finite means being closed.
- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or even beyond, but how is this possible?

### From parabola to problem more generally  
- Cutting off parabolic side equivalent to letting outside in: suitors; spectacles. Openness in deeper sense goes hand in hand with side remaining infinite. But how?
	- Pascal insight might be good here. A circle without a point is just a line. Cannot remain itself qua figure and be open
- Being open to one thing means being open to everything. This is predicament. (But also perhaps solution; see below)
- Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing (see below for another version of this).
- To be something is not to be anything else. So how to be open to everything else, without becoming nothing, vanishing.
- To be something is not to be anything else. But this means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything else.
- Santayana on necessity of being closed
	> - Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the condition for existing at all, for having a vocation, and for establishing an interest, even formal and unconscious, by which to distinguish life from death, benefit from injury.
- Santayana on how being closed also means being open?
	- Implication of openness in existence
		> Santayana RB page 282: "That a thing by its internal being should have reference to something external ... is so far from being an anomaly or an exception that it is the indispensable condition for existing at all."
	- Openness from page 617 Santayana:
		> ”But such a selection cannot be made beforehand. In exploring you cannot first decide what you shall discover; you must explore everything that offers, and then perhaps select the part that it concerns you to study."
- Being open: something fateful in the advent of perception that makes it all or nothing. (Contra Kant. See Santayana quote just above.)
- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of form requires the world for support, but also puts it at risk, requiring it to be seen.
- Inside bounded while outside unbounded


#### Jar as one image of problem
- Move to jar. Seems a counterexample. But proves this by having an inside that can contain what it receives from outside. Infinite difference between being outside and being inside. A trick. Reliant on beings with insides.
- Jar, filled but needing to be closed
- Suppose I open a tightly closed jar by breaking it. Why do
  we hesitate to say I have thereby opened the jar? revise
- Opening a jar does not mean smashing it on the ground: this destroys the difference between inside and outside
- Contents of jar spoil unless closed. Price of being open is being continuous with everything else. Like a plate rather than a jar. Interior vanishes.
- Jar lid doesn't belong to world to which jar us open? (Perhaps put below in solution)
- Hospitality: suitors filling Odysseus’s house in Homer’s Odyssey
- Perception and Intellect: Leontius in Republic getting his fill of a sight.
- And how to link to presence/absence? Odyessus absent; Leontius no longer mastering his eyes. But how to link to paradox of presence and absence in cognition: the sense in which to be about something means not belonging to that something? Explore paradox in these terms.
- Page 54, FFR Schopenhauer: “Consequently, the understanding had first to create the objective world itself. It cannot, however, stroll into our head ready-made through the senses and the openings of their organs.”
- Openness more than stimulus: a closed system is capable of being moved and moving in return. In openness there is a sense of allowing the outside to come in. (Or of going out?). But how can the outside come in without destroying the inside.
- How can there be a continuity between inside and outside, yet one that preserves the dimensional difference.
- Paradox: how does one establish continuity between inside and outside that preserves dimensional difference between inside and outside?
- Note: openness indicates a threshold, from inside to outside, not just a continuity. (Perhaps senior oral stuff could go here.)
- Openness not merely a continuity, but a threshold between inside and outside. A relation between the two that preserves their dimensionality.
- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that distinction between inside and outside is not just dimensional but Ontological.

#### Accounts of perception and Intellect another sign of problem 
- Openness, at least in the context of mind, or awareness, is not merely a blank receptivity but a more discriminating, active "letting in", akin to opening the door. It involves a revelation of the world rather than just a reception of it. This could be a way of asking the question: why is being open a matter of the world's being revealed in being received? Or why is openness a word we use in cognition?

- Perhaps could use Bergson account from Matter and Memory here.

- Could also use Meillassoux account as example of modern philosophy
making things closed.

- Perhaps use Bergson and Meillassoux together, as example of
of shift from non-philosophical account to philosophical account, where
openness shifts to closedness.

- Use Aristotle and Kant (and Descartes) together as ways of struggling with the paradox of openness. Also connect problem of openness with problem of understanding how there can be things *about* the world in the world.
	- Most radical philosopher of openness Aristotle
	- Kant: openness becomes transcendental: being nowhere in one's field, a source of possibility. (Heidegger)
- More on importance of “aboutness”: Aboutness of consciousness gives us something to live *for*, something to care *about*. A distance that makes alliance and commitment possible. Also makes sense of thoughts, opinions, words, and more than just additions to the world.
- Focus on perception and intellect, contrasting Aristotle and Kant, on absence and presence
- To be something is not to be anything else. But this means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything else.
- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of form requires the world for support, but also puts it at risk, requiring it to be seen.
- Inside bounded while outside unbounded
- Possible transition to “absence” of eyes and presence: Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing
- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that distinction between inside and outside is not just dimensional but Ontological.
- Shift from outside to inside a shift from extrinsic relations to intrinsic
- Distinction between inside and outside, is more deeply between intensive and extensive, and still more deeply, as a spiritual predicament, between the given, and accidental, and the ideal, and obligatory.
- World is reversed in going from outside to inside in perception or intellection. This is what causes the problem of appearance and reality.
- Little prince boa constrictor vs hat: having an inside
- To be open is to be, in a radical sense, invisible. Openness is absence.

##### Eyes need to be absent
- Make basic issue here the sense in which being about something means not belonging to something (sense in which eyes need to be absent)
- How can there be something in the world that is about that world? Something that belongs to the world not merely as a part of it, but as a revelation of it? (But compare to Santayana quote below)
- Also liken eye present or vanishing to omniscient narrator.
- Absence indicated in third-person narration. Presence in first or second.
- Third and second person narration: eye vanished and eye present. But what about first person narration? Third: narration. Second: drama. First: soliloquy. (Perhaps put soliloquy below in idea of containing world). 
- Perhaps mention the cuts from scene to scene in movies: we don’t need to ask how did we get instantly from one place to another.
- Mention quantum mechanics, observer not influencing what is observed?
- In experience, our "invisibility" reflected in an awareness of "objects" that precludes any corresponding awareness of the subjective instruments that deliver us to those objects.
- When we put ourselves in world, relation now to us rather than in itself
- Absence of eyes: Eye image reversed, two, and two-dimensional, and without distance. (From Schopenhauer Fourfold).
- Mark of eye's invisibility: we have two eyes, but they provide one field of objects
- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at first lecture. Also look at Aristotle on intellect. Also Benardete.

##### Eyes need to be present
- In what sense is view from nowhere indeed a view?
	- Perhaps look at Nagel: view from nowhere
- In itself of world in causality
- Hume and Kant on causality
- Santayana from RB (xiii):
	> - Perspectives are essential to animal apprehension; an observer, himself a part of the world he observes, must have a particular station in it; he cannot be equally near to everything, nor internal to anything but himself; of the rest he can only take views, abstracted according to his sensibility and foreshortened according to his interests.
- Related Santayana RB (xxx-xxxi)
	> - In an animal psyche as complex and as delicately organized as the human, the spirit has a wider basis and comes to light in more ways and in more places than we might at first suspect. *And at each point where it flowers at all, it flowers into something original.* The ear yields one unprecedented character to the sum of existence in yielding sound, and the eye another unprecedented element in yielding visual light and colour. The same organic machinery, in other places and motions, yields the unprecedented elements of pleasure and pain and all the emotions. Nor is the originality of the pigments the whole originality in the spiritual picture. Memory lights up perspectives which in nature can subsist only as dead relations between dead facts; and expectation, contradiction, doubts and surprise vivify the mechanism of instinct and turn plodding existence into a series of comedies…. We should never become poets in the end had we not been essentially poets from the beginning. 
- Nietzsche on perspective?
- Basic conclusion: eyes need to be both absent yet present for seeing to be possible. “Openness” seems to indicate this dialectical predicament of absence and presence. Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing; being something by being nothing else. 
- Santayana on necessity of being closed
> - Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the condition for existing at all, for having a vocation, and for establishing an interest, even formal and unconscious, by which to distinguish life from death, benefit from injury.
- But note: Seeing things *as* they are: reduplication through "as" joins presence and absence of eyes.
- Eyes contain world insofar as they are invisible, but contained by the world insofar as they are visible.

## Part Two: Paradox Resolved

### Parabola:
- Parabola is infinitely open at end, leaving no room outside it. Perhaps the secret to openness.
- Openness and closedness integrated in containment or comprehension of everything
	- This in contrast to the hyperbola and its asymptotes
- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or even beyond. Containment allows this to happen somehow.

### From parabola to solution more generally:
- We are the beings who are open. (Heidegger on possibility.) 
- Being open to one thing means being open to everything, but cast this now in the form of containment rather than exposure.
- Possibly use Leibniz?
- Show solution in terms of perception and intellect.
	- Eyes present as if at a kind of circumference to the world, or field of vision, rather than within the world.
	- Perhaps we contain the world in openness as the boundary contains the circle This would also locate us in the middle, at the center of the circle.
		- Hjelmslev disc as the circle of comprehension? Does it illuminate boundary of circle?
	- Always at the center of our perceptual field
	- Openness locates what is open at a center of things in the world.
	- This goes hand in hand with sense in which we are not merely “nowhere” in seeing, nor “somewhere” within world as one among  many, but rather at the exact point in the world where we are alone. 
		- Schopenhauer quote on representation could go here.
		- Universality of consciousness/spirit: in Schopenhauer that one death means death of world
	- The same power that allows us to encompass the world also makes us individual, alone.
	- Integration of eyes missing and eyes present: being in the world ... alone.
	- The possibility of representation inverts the relation of self to world: the self is now, in a sense, responsible for the world. The world comes to be in wakefulness, and sin is found in the self. 
	- Related to sense in which we are visitors to world, and perhaps to how images are signs rather than substances.=
	- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at first lecture.
	- Openness is to a field, the "objects" are really relations. (Take music as an example).
	- Christian insight : spirit *sent* into the world. This makes spirit guiltless for the world, and deserving in sin for forgiveness 
	- Santayana RB p. 761:
		> - Spirit has been sent into the world by the very power by which the world was created; and it aspires to live, and to find a good and beautiful world to live in. etc. (Note that here S. says that apart from accidents spirit in us is identical with spirit everywhere, a divine witness, a divine sufferer, immortal, and only temporarily and involuntarily incarnate in a myriad distracted lives.
	- The given has an ideal character: this is how it can contain the world
	-  RB Santayana p. 633:
		> - Matter would never have evolved into animals, had not organization been potential in it from the beginning; and organization would never have awakened consciousness had not essence and truth overarched existence from all eternity, and summed it up, with all its perspectives ready, for spirit to perceive."


### Possible link to light
- Could openness finally be light?
- Try to incorporate necessity of light in the idea of eyes being open
- Light connecting absence and presence of eyes: allows us to see, but also to be seen
- Light connects the present eye and the absent eye.
- Power of sight and invisibility: Gyges in Herodotus
- Try to write account of why openness is somehow like light
	- Invisibility in openness like that of the burning wick, eclipsed by the glow it produces. Perhaps explains how eye disappears?
	- Open a curtain: suggests that openness has something to do with light

### Other thoughts to bring into lecture
- Basic form of extrinsicness, time, means existence, and sense of existence, is temporal.
- Not sure what I meant with above thought. Perhaps this is way to clarify division of inside from outside. Our sense of what lies outside us, as extrinsic, involves time. But our domain of awareness makes the extrinsic intrinsic, with a corresponding removal from the flux of time into an idea, or image, that is atemporal. Perhaps could spell this out.
- PS to Brendan message: my own thinking about this is centered on the following idea: existence is what makes otherwise purely intrinsic relations extrinsic. The difference between the painting of a landscape and the real landscape it's a painting of, for example, would be that in the painting, the relation of ground to sky is internal to the painting; there is an important sense in which the ground is not outside the sky (or vice versa) as elements of the painting. But in the real, or existing landscape, the ground *is* outside the sky. And this is what it means for it to be real or existing, and not just an image in a frame.
- Try to connect this to the field of perception as being unframed. Elements are outside one another. Perhaps this sense of extrinsicness is a sense of an infinite totality unbounded. A perspective does not have “sharp” boundaries. 
- Existence takes what would otherwise be intrinsic in relation and makes it extrinsic.
- Perhaps include discussion of "literacy" and liberal arts in discussion of perception. Perception as a way not of seeing the world, but of reading the world. Then move from symbolic in this sense to example in music, and Bach in particular. Perhaps this relates to idea of “things” in awareness as symbols.
- Look at Augustine 8.5

# Conclusion

# Leftovers
- The word "open" also transcends grammar: verb (transitive and intransitive), adverb, adjective
	- He opened the door
	- The door opened slowly
	- The door is open
	- The open door distracted him
	- The door swung open
