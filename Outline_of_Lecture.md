- On Being Open 

# Introduction

## Range of usage of "open" and significance

[comment]: # Try to incorporate the "Open" viewbook

The word "open", the topic of my lecture tonight, is used
ways that range from the prosaic to the profound. 

    - "I can't get the jar open." 
    - "When does the store open?"
    - “The window is open.” 
    - "He's an open book." 
    - "My door is always open."
    - "Keep an open mind."
    - "Open your heart."
    - "My eyes were finally opened."

The word "open," then, has great scope; and this is one
reason to wonder about it. Another reason is that the word
is used without further explanation, as if its meaning were
already understood. But if it is only a philosopher, as
Aristotle once remarked, that would care about the difference
between Socrates and Socrates sitting, then perhaps the
difference between a door and an *open* door is a fitting
subject for further thought. And while it would be rude
to ask a friend what he meant after telling you his 
door is always open, well, what *does* it mean? 

Still another reason to wonder about the word "open" comes
from the way it is usually defined through negation.
To be open, our dictionaries will tell us, means *not* to be
closed. Or blocked. Or covered. Or fastened. Or sealed. Or
buttoned. Or guarded. Or protected. Or folded. Or clenched.
Or concealed. Or constipated. This may be enough definition
for everyday use. But what then about those profounder
moments of speech, when we talk of *eyes* being opened, or
hearts, or minds, or again the proverbial door, always open
to you? Here, it seems, we use the word "open" for
a positive condition, a state of being, which any negative
definition at best only half-comprehends. And to ask about
the meaning of "open" in this sense is to ask about the
meaning of hospitality, generosity, enlightenment, love. 

## Introduction to paradox in the idea of being open

But there is a final reason to wonder about the word "open",
which brings me to my lecture tonight. For if we do consider
openness a state of being, and try to make further sense of
it, we quickly encounter a paradox. And in the first half of
my lecture, I want to offer an account of this paradox, and
what I see as its significance. In the second half of the
lecture, I will propose one resolution of the paradox.

# Body of Lecture

## Part One: Paradox Presented

### Jar example:

To begin to see the paradox in openness, then, let me start
with this question: What does it mean for a jar, say of
pickles, to be opened?

A first answer, a dictionary answer, might be: for the lid
of the jar to be removed. 

But why the lid, exactly? Suppose I decide not to trouble
myself with the lid, and simply throw the jar to the ground,
breaking it open. Why is this not simply another way of
opening the jar?

Well, when we say the jar is opened, it seems we want the
jar to remain a jar: something opened without being broken.
Or to put the point more abstractly: we want the word
"opened" in this case to mean that the barrier between the
jar's inside and outside has been removed, without the
distinction between inside and outside being erased. Or
still more abstractly: we want the word "open" to refer to
the sense in which there is continuity, yet at the same time
distinctness, between inside and outside.

But this, then, is the paradox lurking in the word "open".
For how can there be continuity, yet at the same time
distinctness, *discontinuity*, between the inside and
outside of the jar? How can any continuous path from inside
the jar out, or outside in, preserve this
distinction rather than erase it? After all, if we leave the
jar of pickles open, they will sooner or later spoil. ---As if
for nature, even if not for us, there is no difference
between an open jar and a broken jar; no real distinction,
that is, between inside and outside once the barrier between
them has been removed. 

### Parabola example:

Nor is this a problem just for nature. Consider an analogous
case in geometry: [the
parabola](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tlziqt2g1dkmwbi/parabola_ex.png?dl=0).
It is easy enough to distinguish between the sides of this
line, one convex and one concave, since the parabola is
curved. But suppose we went further, and said that the
convex side is "inside" the parabola, and the concave side
"outside," as if the line of the parabola formed a figure,
analogous to ellipse, only open rather than closed. I might
object that the analogy only holds so far as the ends of the
parabola are extended past any point in the geometric plane,
in order to tell, unequivocally, whether that point will lie
on the convex side or the concave of the parabola, if it is
not found to lie on the parabola itself. Yet once we extend
the ends of the parabola this far---to the very edge, as it
were, of geometric space---there will be no way to get from
outside in, or inside out, through the parabola's open end,
since this is now infinitely far away. And again it seems as
if the only way to distinguish inside from outside clearly,
distinctly, truly, is by a barrier---even when the barrier
never closes upon itself, giving us the tantalizing look of
an opening forever beyond our reach.  


### From parabola to problem more generally  

Nor is the paradox limited to jars and parabolas: consider
the open door we find in Homer's *Odyssey*, one that allows
the suitors of Penelope to fill the house of Odysseus in his
absence, but in the *abuse* of hospitality. Or consider the
open eyes of Leontius in Plato's *Republic*, that allow
rotting corpses to fill his gaze, to his own contempt, in
a corruption of sight. Both examples suggest there is at
least a threshold, if not a barrier, between inside
from outside in cases of openness to be praised rather than
condemned. But what *is* this threshold? And if it does
exist, what makes it a threshold rather than a barrier?

The difficulty of answering such a question can be glimpsed
in a remark the philosopher Schopenhauer once made, against
sheer openness, when he said that the world "cannot stroll
into our head ready-made through the senses and the openings
of their organs". Fair enough---against anyone tempted to
take a phrase like "open eyes" literally. But Schopenhauer's
own inference from this is that the world is a product of
the understanding---as if there were nothing truly outside
us to be seen, making the phrase "open eyes" not just
figurative, but false. Schopenhauer's most famous work, *The
World as Will and Representation*, similarly begins by
treating the eyes as if they were opaque rather than
transparent; and the world they reveal, immanent rather
than transcendent: 

> "The world is my representation": this is a truth valid
with reference to every living and knowing being, although
man alone can bring it into reflective, abstract
consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical
discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and
certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but
only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth;
that the world around him is there only as representation,
in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely
that which represents, and this is himself.

The self-containment of this passage, and philosophical
discernment, is not just Schopenhauer's but philosophy's.

> Everything is inside because in order to think anything
whatsoever, it is necessary to 'be able to be conscious of
it', it is necessary to say it, and so we are locked up in
language or in consciousness without being able to get out.
In this sense, they have no outside. But in another sense,
they are entirely turned towards the outside; they are the
world’s window: for to be conscious is always to be
conscious of something, to speak is necessarily to speak
about something. To be conscious of the tree is to be
conscious of the tree itself, and not the idea of the tree;
to speak about the tree is not just to utter a word but to
speak about the thing. Consequently, consciousness and
language enclose the world within themselves only insofar
as, conversely, they are entirely contained by it. We are in
consciousness or language as in a transparent cage.
Everything is outside, yet it is impossible to get out.

Meillassoux (Perhaps just use this quote):

> For it could be that contemporary philosophers have lost
the great outdoors, the absolute outside of pre-critical
thinkers: that outside which was not relative to us, and
which was given as indifferent to its own givenness to be
what it is, existing in itself regardless of whether we are
thinking of it or not; that outside which thought could
explore with the legitimate feeling of being on foreign
territory – of being entirely elsewhere. 

Meillassoux, Quentin (2009-11-05). After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency (p. 7). Bloomsbury Publishing. Kindle Edition. 
Schopenhauer he .  what
to make of Schopenhauer's inference from this?
"Consequently," he infers, "the understanding had first to
create the objective world itself." (Revise from here,
perhaps include Schopenhauer's remark on not seeing the sun
but an eye that sees the sun.)


- Use examples from *Odyssey* and *Republic* to show
problem in "open doors" and "open eyes": If openness
can indeed be a state of being, it is not a matter
of mere continuity between inside and outside; there
is a threshold. But how to make sense of this
threshold?

    - Note: openness indicates a threshold, from inside to
      outside, not just a continuity. (Perhaps senior oral
      stuff could go here.)

    - Perhaps threshold preserves dimensional difference.

    - Openness not merely a continuity, but a threshold
      between inside and outside. A relation between the two
      that preserves their dimensionality.

    - Hospitality: suitors filling Odysseus’s house in
      Homer’s Odyssey

    - Perception and Intellect: Leontius in Republic getting
      his fill of a sight.

    - And how to link to presence/absence? Odyessus absent;
      Leontius no longer mastering his eyes. But how to link
      to paradox of presence and absence in cognition: the
      sense in which to be about something means not
      belonging to that something? Explore paradox in these
      terms.

    - Cutting off parabolic side equivalent to letting
      outside in: suitors; spectacles. Openness in deeper
      sense goes hand in hand with side remaining infinite.
      But how?

    - Parabola proves a kind of image of right sort of
    openness.

- But hard to know what this is. (Perhaps move from
this to Bergson.)

#### Leftovers from outline

- Being open to one thing means being open to everything.
  This is predicament. (But also perhaps solution; see
  below)

- Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing
  (see below for another version of this).

- To be something is not to be anything else. So how to be
  open to everything else, without becoming nothing,
  vanishing.

- To be something is not to be anything else. But this
  means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything
  else.

- Santayana on necessity of being closed

	> - Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the
	    condition for existing at all, for having
	    a vocation, and for establishing an interest,
	    even formal and unconscious, by which to
	    distinguish life from death, benefit from
	    injury.

- Santayana on how being closed also means being open?

	- Implication of openness in existence

	    > Santayana RB page 282: "That a thing by its
	    internal being should have reference to
	    something external ... is so far from being an
	    anomaly or an exception that it is the
	    indispensable condition for existing at all."

	- Openness from page 617 Santayana: 
	
	    > ”But such a selection cannot be made
	    beforehand. In exploring you cannot first decide
	    what you shall discover; you must explore
	    everything that offers, and then perhaps select
	    the part that it concerns you to study."

- Being open: something fateful in the advent of perception
  that makes it all or nothing. (Contra Kant. See Santayana
  quote just above.)

- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world
  distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps
  necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of
  form requires the world for support, but also puts it at
  risk, requiring it to be seen.

- Inside bounded while outside unbounded

- Page 54, FFR Schopenhauer: “Consequently, the
  understanding had first to create the objective world
  itself. It cannot, however, stroll into our head
  ready-made through the senses and the openings of their
  organs.”

- Openness more than stimulus: a closed system is capable of
  being moved and moving in return. In openness there is
  a sense of allowing the outside to come in. (Or of going
  out?). But how can the outside come in without destroying
  the inside.

- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that
  distinction between inside and outside is not just
  dimensional but Ontological.

#### Accounts of perception and Intellect another sign of problem 

- Openness, at least in the context of mind, or awareness,
  is not merely a blank receptivity but a more
  discriminating, active "letting in", akin to opening the
  door. It involves a revelation of the world rather than
  just a reception of it. This could be a way of asking the
  question: why is being open a matter of the world's being
  revealed in being received? Or why is openness a word we
  use in cognition?

- Perhaps could use Bergson account from Matter and Memory here.

- Could also use Meillassoux account as example of modern philosophy
making things closed.

- Perhaps use Bergson and Meillassoux together, as example
  of of shift from non-philosophical account to
  philosophical account, where openness shifts to
  closedness.

- Use Aristotle and Kant (and Descartes) together as ways of
  struggling with the paradox of openness. Also connect
  problem of openness with problem of understanding how
  there can be things *about* the world in the world.

	- Most radical philosopher of openness Aristotle

	- Kant: openness becomes transcendental: being
	  nowhere in one's field, a source of possibility.
	  (Heidegger)

- More on importance of “aboutness”: Aboutness of
  consciousness gives us something to live *for*, something
  to care *about*. A distance that makes alliance and
  commitment possible. Also makes sense of thoughts,
  opinions, words, and more than just additions to the
  world.

- Focus on perception and intellect, contrasting Aristotle
  and Kant, on absence and presence

- To be something is not to be anything else. But this
  means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything
  else.

- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world
  distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps
  necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of
  form requires the world for support, but also puts it at
  risk, requiring it to be seen.

- Inside bounded while outside unbounded

- Possible transition to “absence” of eyes and presence:
  Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing

- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that
  distinction between inside and outside is not just
  dimensional but Ontological.

- Shift from outside to inside a shift from extrinsic
  relations to intrinsic

- Distinction between inside and outside, is more deeply
  between intensive and extensive, and still more deeply, as
  a spiritual predicament, between the given, and
  accidental, and the ideal, and obligatory.

- World is reversed in going from outside to inside in
  perception or intellection. This is what causes the
  problem of appearance and reality.

- Little prince boa constrictor vs hat: having an inside

- To be open is to be, in a radical sense, invisible.
  Openness is absence.

##### Eyes need to be absent

- Make basic issue here the sense in which being about
  something means not belonging to something (sense in which
  eyes need to be absent)

- How can there be something in the world that is about that
  world? Something that belongs to the world not merely as
  a part of it, but as a revelation of it? (But compare to
  Santayana quote below)

- Also liken eye present or vanishing to omniscient
  narrator.

- Absence indicated in third-person narration. Presence in
  first or second.

- Third and second person narration: eye vanished and eye
  present. But what about first person narration? Third:
  narration. Second: drama. First: soliloquy. (Perhaps put
  soliloquy below in idea of containing world). 

- Perhaps mention the cuts from scene to scene in movies: we
  don’t need to ask how did we get instantly from one place
  to another.

- Mention quantum mechanics, observer not influencing what
  is observed?

- In experience, our "invisibility" reflected in an
  awareness of "objects" that precludes any corresponding
  awareness of the subjective instruments that deliver us to
  those objects.

- When we put ourselves in world, relation now to us rather
  than in itself

- Absence of eyes: Eye image reversed, two, and
  two-dimensional, and without distance. (From Schopenhauer
  Fourfold).

- Mark of eye's invisibility: we have two eyes, but they
  provide one field of objects

- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at
  first lecture. Also look at Aristotle on intellect. Also
  Benardete.

##### Eyes need to be present

- In what sense is view from nowhere indeed a view?

	- Perhaps look at Nagel: view from nowhere

- In itself of world in causality

- Hume and Kant on causality

- Santayana from RB (xiii):

	> - Perspectives are essential to animal
	    apprehension; an observer, himself a part of the
	    world he observes, must have a particular
	    station in it; he cannot be equally near to
	    everything, nor internal to anything but
	    himself; of the rest he can only take views,
	    abstracted according to his sensibility and
	    foreshortened according to his interests.

- Related Santayana RB (xxx-xxxi)

	> - In an animal psyche as complex and as delicately
	    organized as the human, the spirit has a wider
	    basis and comes to light in more ways and in
	    more places than we might at first suspect. *And
	    at each point where it flowers at all, it
	    flowers into something original.* The ear yields
	    one unprecedented character to the sum of
	    existence in yielding sound, and the eye another
	    unprecedented element in yielding visual light
	    and colour. The same organic machinery, in other
	    places and motions, yields the unprecedented
	    elements of pleasure and pain and all the
	    emotions. Nor is the originality of the pigments
	    the whole originality in the spiritual picture.
	    Memory lights up perspectives which in nature
	    can subsist only as dead relations between dead
	    facts; and expectation, contradiction, doubts
	    and surprise vivify the mechanism of instinct
	    and turn plodding existence into a series of
	    comedies…. We should never become poets in the
	    end had we not been essentially poets from the
	    beginning. 

- Nietzsche on perspective?

- Basic conclusion: eyes need to be both absent yet present
  for seeing to be possible. “Openness” seems to indicate
  this dialectical predicament of absence and presence.
  Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing;
  being something by being nothing else. 

- Santayana on necessity of being closed 

    > Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the
    condition for existing at all, for having a vocation,
    and for establishing an interest, even formal and
    unconscious, by which to distinguish life from death,
    benefit from injury.

- But note: Seeing things *as* they are: reduplication
  through "as" joins presence and absence of eyes.

- Eyes contain world insofar as they are invisible, but
  contained by the world insofar as they are visible.


## Part Two: Paradox Resolved

### Revisiting of Parabola
- Parabola is infinitely open at end, leaving no room outside it. Perhaps the secret to openness.
- Openness and closedness integrated in containment or comprehension of everything
	- This in contrast to the hyperbola and its asymptotes
- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or even beyond. Containment allows this to happen somehow.

### From parabola to solution more generally:
- We are the beings who are open. (Heidegger on possibility.) 
- Being open to one thing means being open to everything, but cast this now in the form of containment rather than exposure.
- Possibly use Leibniz?
- Show solution in terms of perception and intellect.
	- Eyes present as if at a kind of circumference to the world, or field of vision, rather than within the world.
	- Perhaps we contain the world in openness as the boundary contains the circle This would also locate us in the middle, at the center of the circle.
		- Hjelmslev disc as the circle of comprehension? Does it illuminate boundary of circle?
	- Always at the center of our perceptual field
	- Openness locates what is open at a center of things in the world.
	- This goes hand in hand with sense in which we are not merely “nowhere” in seeing, nor “somewhere” within world as one among  many, but rather at the exact point in the world where we are alone. 
		- Schopenhauer quote on representation could go here.
		- Universality of consciousness/spirit: in Schopenhauer that one death means death of world
	- The same power that allows us to encompass the world also makes us individual, alone.
	- Integration of eyes missing and eyes present: being in the world ... alone.
	- The possibility of representation inverts the relation of self to world: the self is now, in a sense, responsible for the world. The world comes to be in wakefulness, and sin is found in the self. 
	- Related to sense in which we are visitors to world, and perhaps to how images are signs rather than substances.=
	- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at first lecture.
	- Openness is to a field, the "objects" are really relations. (Take music as an example).
	- Christian insight : spirit *sent* into the world. This makes spirit guiltless for the world, and deserving in sin for forgiveness 
	- Santayana RB p. 761:
		> - Spirit has been sent into the world by the very power by which the world was created; and it aspires to live, and to find a good and beautiful world to live in. etc. (Note that here S. says that apart from accidents spirit in us is identical with spirit everywhere, a divine witness, a divine sufferer, immortal, and only temporarily and involuntarily incarnate in a myriad distracted lives.
	- The given has an ideal character: this is how it can contain the world
	-  RB Santayana p. 633:
		> - Matter would never have evolved into animals, had not organization been potential in it from the beginning; and organization would never have awakened consciousness had not essence and truth overarched existence from all eternity, and summed it up, with all its perspectives ready, for spirit to perceive."


### Possible link to light
- Could openness finally be light?
- Try to incorporate necessity of light in the idea of eyes being open
- Light connecting absence and presence of eyes: allows us to see, but also to be seen
- Light connects the present eye and the absent eye.
- Power of sight and invisibility: Gyges in Herodotus
- Try to write account of why openness is somehow like light
	- Invisibility in openness like that of the burning wick, eclipsed by the glow it produces. Perhaps explains how eye disappears?
	- Open a curtain: suggests that openness has something to do with light

### Other thoughts to bring into lecture
- Basic form of extrinsicness, time, means existence, and sense of existence, is temporal.
- Not sure what I meant with above thought. Perhaps this is way to clarify division of inside from outside. Our sense of what lies outside us, as extrinsic, involves time. But our domain of awareness makes the extrinsic intrinsic, with a corresponding removal from the flux of time into an idea, or image, that is atemporal. Perhaps could spell this out.
- PS to Brendan message: my own thinking about this is centered on the following idea: existence is what makes otherwise purely intrinsic relations extrinsic. The difference between the painting of a landscape and the real landscape it's a painting of, for example, would be that in the painting, the relation of ground to sky is internal to the painting; there is an important sense in which the ground is not outside the sky (or vice versa) as elements of the painting. But in the real, or existing landscape, the ground *is* outside the sky. And this is what it means for it to be real or existing, and not just an image in a frame.
- Try to connect this to the field of perception as being unframed. Elements are outside one another. Perhaps this sense of extrinsicness is a sense of an infinite totality unbounded. A perspective does not have “sharp” boundaries. 
- Existence takes what would otherwise be intrinsic in relation and makes it extrinsic.
- Perhaps include discussion of "literacy" and liberal arts in discussion of perception. Perception as a way not of seeing the world, but of reading the world. Then move from symbolic in this sense to example in music, and Bach in particular. Perhaps this relates to idea of “things” in awareness as symbols.
- Look at Augustine 8.5

# Conclusion

# Leftovers
- The word "open" also transcends grammar: verb (transitive and intransitive), adverb, adjective
	- He opened the door
	- The door opened slowly
	- The door is open
	- The open door distracted him
	- The door swung open

### Parabola:

Geometric example of being closed: a figure.

    - Euclid definition of figure: I.14: 

        > A figure is that which is contained by 
        any boundary or boundaries.

	- Note that "that which is contained" indicates an
	  inside or interior.

    - First example of figure in Euclid: circle

	> A circle is a plane figure contained by one line
	such that all the straight lines falling upon it
	from one point among those lying within the figure
	equal one another.

- Apollonian complication of figure:

    - A plane introduced into a cone produces conic sections.
    The circle is one, as is the ellipse. But the parabola
    and hyperbola are also produced, and they seem to be lines,
    strictly speaking, rather than figures.

* Imagine a parabola whose line continues, in either
direction, without end.

    - Is parabola a line or a figure? As a conic
    section the answer is ambiguous: the ellipse
    is closed, and hence a figure; but the cutting
    plane's continuous tilt eventually yields the
    parabola, the first open figure, which is thus
    a line.

    - Geometric terms already show an issue: figures
    are closed, so a parabola becomes a line, even
    though it is a figure.

- Image of openness but actually closed

- No way to go from outside to inside

- Openness a bridge between inside and outside, but how?

- Is the parabola really open? In the way the circle was?
  Push this paradox. How does one get from outside to inside
  the parabola?

- Perhaps use Apollonius Book II or Pascal as illustrations

	- In Pascal connection drawn between parabola and
	  a circle missing only a point. (Could this be used
	  later?)

	- Mathematical image of openness:

		- Circle with a point missing being an
		  ellipse, where the missing point becomes
		  an infinite expanse, transcending the
		  cone, produced by a "rotation" of the
		  cutting plane in a different direction, or
		  dimension, from the direction of the cone.

- Parabola: being open means being infinite. Being finite
  means being closed.

- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from
  outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or
  even beyond, but how is this possible?
