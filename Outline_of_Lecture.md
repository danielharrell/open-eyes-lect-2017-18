# Introduction {#intro}

<!--
Try to incorporate the "Open" viewbook
-->

The word "open", the topic of my lecture tonight, is used
in ways that range from the prosaic to the profound. 

    - "I can't get the jar open." 
    - "When does the store open?"
    - “The window is open.” 
    - "He's an open book." 
    - "My door is always open."
    - "Keep an open mind."
    - "Open your heart."
    - "My eyes were finally opened."

The word "open," then, has great scope; this is one reason
to wonder about it. Another reason is that the word is
typically used without further explanation, as if its
meaning were already understood. But if it is only
a philosopher, as Aristotle once remarked, that would care
about the difference between Socrates and Socrates sitting,
then perhaps the difference between a door and an *open*
door is a fitting subject for further thought.[^1] And while it
would be rude to ask a friend what he meant after telling
you his door is *always* open, well, what *did* he mean? 

Still another reason to wonder about the word "open" comes
from the way it is defined in dictionaries through negation.
To be open means *not* to be closed. Or blocked. Or covered.
Or fastened. Or sealed. Or buttoned. Or guarded. Or
protected. Or folded. Or clenched. Or concealed. Or
constipated.[^2] This may be enough definition for everyday use.
But what then about those profounder moments of speech, when
we talk of *eyes* being opened, or hearts, or minds, or
again the proverbial door, always open to you? Here, it
seems, we use the word "open" for a positive condition,
a state of being, which any negative definition at best only
half-comprehends. And to ask about the meaning of "open" in
this affirmative sense is to ask about the meaning of hospitality,
generosity, enlightenment, love. 

But there is a final reason to wonder about the word "open",
which brings me to my lecture tonight. For if we do consider
openness a state of being, and try to make further sense of
it, we quickly encounter a paradox. I will introduce this
paradox in the first part of my lecture; explore it further
in a second part; and try to resolve it in a final part.

# Part One: Paradox introduced {#one}

## The paradox of the jar {#jar}

To begin to see the paradox in openness, let me start
with this question: What does it mean for a jar, say of
pickles, to be opened?

A first answer, a dictionary answer, might be: for the lid
of the jar to be removed. 

But why the lid? Suppose I decide not to bother
with the lid, and throw the jar to the ground,
breaking it open. Why is this not simply another way of
opening the jar? Why do we call it a breaking-open
rather than a merely-open?

Well, when we say the jar is opened, it seems we want the
jar to remain a jar: something opened without being broken.
Or to put the point more abstractly: we want the word
"opened" to mean that the barrier between the
jar's inside and outside has been removed, without the
difference between inside and outside being erased. Or
still more abstractly: we want the word "open" to mean 
that there is continuity, yet at the same time
distinctness, between inside and outside.

But this, then, is the paradox. For how can there be
continuity between inside and outside, yet at the same time
distinctness, or discontinuity? Without the lid to separate
them, how is the jar's inside indeed inside, and not
outside? After all, if we leave the jar of pickles open,
they will sooner or later spoil---as if the jar's inside
were indeed outside, and there were no real difference between
an open jar and a broken jar; no real distinction between
inside and outside once the barrier between them has been
removed. So what makes the distinction real without
this barrier? In what sense can our jar be open at all? 

[Back to top](#top)

## The paradox of the parabola {#parabola}

Nor is this a paradox just for jars.  Consider an analogous
case in geometry: [the
parabola](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tlziqt2g1dkmwbi/parabola_ex.png?dl=0).
<!-- Spell out paradox explicitly in terms of continuity and
discontinuity in parabola --> It is easy enough to
distinguish the sides of this line, one convex and one
concave, since the parabola is curved. But suppose we went
further, and said that the convex side is "inside" the
parabola, and the concave side "outside," as if the line of
the parabola formed a figure, analogous to the ellipse, only
open rather than closed. But the analogy holds, it seems,
only so far as the ends of the parabola are extended past
any point in the geometric plane, in order to tell,
unequivocally, where that point will lie in relation to the
parabola: on its convex side; on its concave side; or on the
parabola itself. Yet once we extend the ends of the parabola
this far---to the very edge, as it were, of geometric
space---there will be no way to get from outside in, or
inside out, through the parabola's open end; for this is now
infinitely far away. So again we encounter the paradox. For
in what sense can our parabola be open at all? It seems that
the only way to distinguish inside from outside clearly,
distinctly, truly, is by a barrier to openness---even when
the barrier in this case never closes upon itself: the open
end of the parabola that we can plainly see, but never
reach; as if openness had no being beyond seeming. 


[Back to top](#top)

## The paradox more generally {#problem}  

Nor is this a paradox just for jars and parabolas. Consider
the open door we find in Homer's *Odyssey*, that allows the
suitors of Penelope to fill the house of Odysseus in his
absence, but in the *abuse* of hospitality. Or the open eyes
of Leontius in Plato's *Republic*, that allow the spectacle
of corpses to fill his gaze, but to his own contempt, in
a similar abuse of sight.[^3] Both examples suggest there is
something between inside and outside that can be broken, in
cases of openness to be condemned. But what is it that
remains intact, then, in cases of openness to be praised?
And how does this *provide* an opening, even protect it,
rather than preclude it?

Or consider the phrase "open eyes" more generally. We might
mean merely that our eyelids are open. But the phrase also
captures how, in normal cases of vision, we seem to see not
*our eyes*, but *through* our eyes, to a world beyond, as if
our eyes were indeed open, even transparent. Still, it is
not as if our eyes could be open like their eyelids, or
a lidless jar, letting the world in. For open eyes can
be poked, injured, even blinded. So how again are they open?
And if they are not like a lidless jar, then how *does* the
world get in? 

But perhaps the world *doesn't* get in, if we
now conceive the eye like a *closed* jar, or *completed*
parabola, and once again call into question the very
possibility of being open. We could argue for this as the
philosopher Schopenhauer once did, when he wrote:

<!-- Look up Payne translation for this -->

> It is therefore the Understanding
itself which has to create the objective world; for this
world cannot walk into our brain from outside all ready cut
and dried through the senses and the openings of their
organs.[^4]

On this reasoning, the way our eyes are *not* like a lidless
jar makes the world we see something produced
rather than revealed---as if there were nothing 
outside us to see, and the phrase "open eyes" were
figurative in being false. Schopenhauer's most famous work,
*The World as Will and Representation*, similarly begins by
treating the eyes as if they were opaque rather than
transparent, and the world we see as if it
were inside us, in a seeming denial of openness:

> "The world is my representation": this is a truth valid
with reference to every living and knowing being, although
man alone can bring it into reflective, abstract
consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical
discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and
certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but
only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth;
that the world around him is there only as representation,
in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely
that which represents, and this is himself.[^6]

On this reasoning, the world we experience as outside us can
only *be* experienced insofar as it lies inside us, in
a relation to us that is given rather than gained.  This may
seem to replace one paradox with another: for if the world
does lie inside us, in being experienced at all, then why do
we experience it as outside us? But we might borrow a line
of thinking from Kant, to whom Schopenhauer was indebted, to
make sense of this. For take space to be like such a world.
It is hard to see how it could lie inside of me, since
I experience it as around me, or outside of me, as if I were
inside of it. Yet I distinguish one part of space as outside
another, and can occupy both in turn, as if I were really
outside and never inside, at least so far as space allowed
me to move: from part to part, one outside the next. So how,
then, do I remain inside of space all the while? Where does
my sense of being inside space come from?

<!--The above thought could be clarified: because any
part of space I occupy can also be a part of space I
don't, and thus a part *outside* me, there is no
sense to be made of my being *inside* space, save
that all parts of space are *in* space.-->

The answer, on this line of thought at least, is that it
comes from me. That is, I have a sense of space that
*contains* space to locate me inside it. And while I move
from part to part, one outside the next, every such part is
*in* space, thanks to my all-encompassing sense of it. Or to
borrow Kant's term for it: I find myself inside space
insofar as space is a form of sensibility. And perhaps we
experience the world that way: as outside us, but *because*
it lies inside us. Without a sense of the world that
contains it, on this view, we would never find ourselves
inside what we can then experience as outside us. And if
this inside sense of world were ever lost, then also lost,
perhaps, would be any sense of outside---at least so far as
this outside might be reached from inside. Once Odysseus,
for example, is no longer master of his door, a world of
hospitality is lost; and now his door can open only one way:
to let the suitors in. Or once Leontius is no longer master
of his eyes, a world of discernment is lost; and now his
eyes can open only one way: to let the corpses in.

## The paradox of the paradox {#paradox}

> Everything is inside because in order to think anything
whatsoever, it is necessary to ‘be able to be conscious of
it’, it is necessary to say it, and so we are locked up in
language or in consciousness without being able to get out.
In this sense, they have no outside. But in another sense,
they are entirely turned towards the outside; they are the
world’s window: for to be conscious is always to be
conscious of something, to speak is necessarily to speak
about something. To be conscious of the tree is to be
conscious of the tree itself, and not the idea of the tree;
to speak about the tree is not just to utter a word but to
speak about the thing. Consequently, consciousness and
language enclose the world within themselves only insofar
as, conversely, they are entirely contained by it. We are in
consciousness or language as in a transparent cage.
Everything is outside, yet it is impossible to get out. 7

Meillassoux, Quentin (2009-11-05). After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency (p. 6). Bloomsbury Publishing. Kindle Edition. 

In any case, the view I am trying to describe here,
and that Schopenhauer credits to the dawning of
philosophical discernment, is compelling enough to
have persuaded. 
still denies our openness to the world, in offering
an ostensible account of it. offers an account of our openness to the world that denies it. and that
Schopenhauer credits to the dawning of philosophical discernment,volves a compelling enough denial of openness to characterize
philosophical thought since Kant. 
This way of explaining openness denies it. 
But the idea of world in this
sense might be thought to *explain* the outside rather than
erase it, and similarly explain the meaning of being open.
Odysseus, for example, goes the
world of hospitality that makes sense of his open door,
leaving a gap once he is gone, perhaps for good. With
Leontius, similarly, goes the world of discernment that
makes sense of his open eyes, leaving a like gap once he too
is gone, in losing mastery over his sight. We can even use
the idea of world to explain our open jar of pickles, in
this case the world of canning and preserving. 

- Our very awareness of an outside, and
of being open to it, comes from a sense of being
inside space---all of space at once.  

- It would be hard, otherwise, to explain how I could think
  of prolonging the ends of the parabola to the edge of the
  geometric plane until they reached the edge of the
  geometric plat space, And if we cast this space in
  geometric terms, conceive this space geometrically, we can
  (World gets differentiated more specifically as we move
  forward.) It is this sense of space as a totality, a kind
  of world, that allows to think of prolonging the ends of
  a parabola to the very edge 

-Perhaps extend argument for this.

- Then move on to point about parabola.


, all of space,  feeling 
located *within* space rather than without. our very awareness of outside, and of
being open to the outside, comes from a sense of being
inside space.  that
is given rather than composed, and that contains us.


- World allows door to be opened.

- Make sense of pickles being canned (last), Leontius, Odyssesus,
Parabola, and Kant on space (as one thing we are "in, but as 
totality that allows me to talk of parabola)" but then
move on to larger paradox in glass cage, great outdoors,
philosophical reflection. es it seem to lie where how can
something inside us be experienced outside us. we experience something as outside us if it really lies
inside us? if the
world lies inside us so far as we can experience it at all,
why do we experience it as outside us? , in
something like the way we can only relate to something
else 

a denial of openness that if it
really lies inside us.at the dawning of philosophical
discernment, Nor is Schopenhauer alone, among philosophers,
in thinking that the world we experience as outside us is
really inside us---a thought he credits here to the dawning
of philosophical discernment. Schopenhauer's great teacher
in this was Kant, who gives painstaking arguments for the
same thought in his first Critique. Here is one example of
his way of putting it: in his first Critique for why I can
only mean the word "outside" for a domain "neitherhis
seeming denial of openness. <!-- Use philosophical
discernment bit to make transition to philosophy more
generally. Then briefly explain how "world-inside-us" can
account for Odysseus and Leontinus (worlds inside doors and
eyes) and also parabola (which swallows whole of geometric
space in its asymptote-less spread. There is no outside,
like infinite ellipse. (Look at example Erica sent.))-->
There is nothing here that Schopenhauer himself wouldn't
credit to Kant. <!-- Find Kant references, either from Kant
or from Schopenhauer. Also perhaps delay quoting of
Meillassoux until after speaking of paradox of paradox. Also
perhaps introduce Kant here, space outside but inside us,
after Schopenhauer. Or alternative: quote Meillassoux, then
go on to quote Kant. Also perhaps bring back earlier quote
from Meillassoux book-->

And every
philosopher since Kant might be thought to have made the
same denial, willing or no---at least if we accept the
suggestion recently made by Quentin Meillassoux, about
what philosophy has lost since Kant:  

> For it could be that contemporary philosophers have lost
the *great outdoors*, the *absolute* outside of pre-critical
thinkers: that outside which was not relative to us, and
which was given as indifferent to its own givenness to be
what it is, existing in itself regardless of whether we are
thinking of it or not; that outside which thought could
explore with the legitimate feeling of being on foreign
territory – of being entirely elsewhere. 

- To conclude this section

    - Point out that it is philosophical reflection
    that allows us to reflect on openness, but also
    philosophical reflection that issues in its denial.

        - Philosophy has a power to wonder about openness,
	but an impotence to save it.
    
        - This is a kind of paradox about the paradox.

    - Also, the denial is about our most common experience
    of openness in perception and being-in-the-world. 
    
    - So why is this? A question that leads me to explore
    the issue further in part 2. 

    - Perhaps also mention that the problem is broader than
    "post-Kantian" philosophy.

# Part Two: Paradox explored {#two}

[Back to top](#top)
Bergson quote: 

> It would greatly astonish a man unaware of the
speculations of philosophy if we told him that the
object before him, which he sees and touches, exists
only in his mind and for his mind or even, more generally,
exists only for mind, as Berkeley held. Such a man would
always maintain that the object exists independently
of the consciousness which perceives it. But, on the 
other hand, we should astonish him quite as much by
telling him that the object is entirely different
from that which is perceived in it, that it has
neither the color ascribed to it by the eye nor the
resistance found in it by the hand. The color, the
resistance, are, for him, in the object: they are not
states of our mind; they are part and parcel of an
existence really independent of our own. For common
sense, then, the object exists in itself, and,
on the other hand, the object is, in itself, pictorial,
as we perceive it: image it is, but a self-existing
image.

    - Basic arc: From Aristotle to Descartes, move
    from thinking as receptivity to thinking as
    activity.

    - Note: openness indicates a threshold, from inside to
      outside, not just a continuity. (Perhaps senior oral
      stuff could go here.)

    - Perhaps threshold preserves dimensional difference.

    - Openness not merely a continuity, but a threshold
      between inside and outside. A relation between the two
      that preserves their dimensionality.

    - And how to link to presence/absence? Odyessus absent;
      Leontius no longer mastering his eyes. But how to link
      to paradox of presence and absence in cognition: the
      sense in which to be about something means not
      belonging to that something? Explore paradox in these
      terms.

    - Cutting off parabolic side equivalent to letting
      outside in: suitors; spectacles. Openness in deeper
      sense goes hand in hand with side remaining infinite.
      But how?

    - Parabola proves a kind of image of right sort of
    openness.

- But hard to know what this is. (Perhaps move from
this to Bergson.)

#### Leftovers from outline

- Being open to one thing means being open to everything.
  This is predicament. (But also perhaps solution; see
  below)

- Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing
  (see below for another version of this).

- To be something is not to be anything else. So how to be
  open to everything else, without becoming nothing,
  vanishing.

- To be something is not to be anything else. But this
  means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything
  else.

- Santayana on necessity of being closed

	> - Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the
	    condition for existing at all, for having
	    a vocation, and for establishing an interest,
	    even formal and unconscious, by which to
	    distinguish life from death, benefit from
	    injury.

- Santayana on how being closed also means being open?

	- Implication of openness in existence

	    > Santayana RB page 282: "That a thing by its
	    internal being should have reference to
	    something external ... is so far from being an
	    anomaly or an exception that it is the
	    indispensable condition for existing at all."

	- Openness from page 617 Santayana: 
	
	    > ”But such a selection cannot be made
	    beforehand. In exploring you cannot first decide
	    what you shall discover; you must explore
	    everything that offers, and then perhaps select
	    the part that it concerns you to study."

- Being open: something fateful in the advent of perception
  that makes it all or nothing. (Contra Kant. See Santayana
  quote just above.)

- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world
  distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps
  necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of
  form requires the world for support, but also puts it at
  risk, requiring it to be seen.

- Inside bounded while outside unbounded

- Page 54, FFR Schopenhauer: “Consequently, the
  understanding had first to create the objective world
  itself. It cannot, however, stroll into our head
  ready-made through the senses and the openings of their
  organs.”

- Openness more than stimulus: a closed system is capable of
  being moved and moving in return. In openness there is
  a sense of allowing the outside to come in. (Or of going
  out?). But how can the outside come in without destroying
  the inside.

- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that
  distinction between inside and outside is not just
  dimensional but Ontological.

#### Accounts of perception and Intellect another sign of problem 

- Openness, at least in the context of mind, or awareness,
  is not merely a blank receptivity but a more
  discriminating, active "letting in", akin to opening the
  door. It involves a revelation of the world rather than
  just a reception of it. This could be a way of asking the
  question: why is being open a matter of the world's being
  revealed in being received? Or why is openness a word we
  use in cognition?

- Perhaps could use Bergson account from Matter and Memory here.

- Could also use Meillassoux account as example of modern philosophy
making things closed.

- Perhaps use Bergson and Meillassoux together, as example
  of of shift from non-philosophical account to
  philosophical account, where openness shifts to
  closedness.

- Use Aristotle and Kant (and Descartes) together as ways of
  struggling with the paradox of openness. Also connect
  problem of openness with problem of understanding how
  there can be things *about* the world in the world.

	- Most radical philosopher of openness Aristotle

	- Kant: openness becomes transcendental: being
	  nowhere in one's field, a source of possibility.
	  (Heidegger)

- More on importance of “aboutness”: Aboutness of
  consciousness gives us something to live *for*, something
  to care *about*. A distance that makes alliance and
  commitment possible. Also makes sense of thoughts,
  opinions, words, and more than just additions to the
  world.

- Focus on perception and intellect, contrasting Aristotle
  and Kant, on absence and presence

- To be something is not to be anything else. But this
  means, on the level of awareness, to be open to everything
  else.

- Inside a reflection of form, outside a reflection of world
  distinguished from form. Being open is perhaps
  necessitated by the way that the gain and maintaining of
  form requires the world for support, but also puts it at
  risk, requiring it to be seen.

- Inside bounded while outside unbounded

- Possible transition to “absence” of eyes and presence:
  Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing

- Use shift from jars to eyes as a way of indicating that
  distinction between inside and outside is not just
  dimensional but Ontological.

- Shift from outside to inside a shift from extrinsic
  relations to intrinsic

- Distinction between inside and outside, is more deeply
  between intensive and extensive, and still more deeply, as
  a spiritual predicament, between the given, and
  accidental, and the ideal, and obligatory.

- World is reversed in going from outside to inside in
  perception or intellection. This is what causes the
  problem of appearance and reality.

- Little prince boa constrictor vs hat: having an inside

- To be open is to be, in a radical sense, invisible.
  Openness is absence.

##### Eyes need to be absent

- Make basic issue here the sense in which being about
  something means not belonging to something (sense in which
  eyes need to be absent)

- How can there be something in the world that is about that
  world? Something that belongs to the world not merely as
  a part of it, but as a revelation of it? (But compare to
  Santayana quote below)

- Also liken eye present or vanishing to omniscient
  narrator.

- Absence indicated in third-person narration. Presence in
  first or second.

- Third and second person narration: eye vanished and eye
  present. But what about first person narration? Third:
  narration. Second: drama. First: soliloquy. (Perhaps put
  soliloquy below in idea of containing world). 

- Perhaps mention the cuts from scene to scene in movies: we
  don’t need to ask how did we get instantly from one place
  to another.

- Mention quantum mechanics, observer not influencing what
  is observed?

- In experience, our "invisibility" reflected in an
  awareness of "objects" that precludes any corresponding
  awareness of the subjective instruments that deliver us to
  those objects.

- When we put ourselves in world, relation now to us rather
  than in itself

- Absence of eyes: Eye image reversed, two, and
  two-dimensional, and without distance. (From Schopenhauer
  Fourfold).

- Mark of eye's invisibility: we have two eyes, but they
  provide one field of objects

- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at
  first lecture. Also look at Aristotle on intellect. Also
  Benardete.

##### Eyes need to be present

- In what sense is view from nowhere indeed a view?

	- Perhaps look at Nagel: view from nowhere

- In itself of world in causality

- Hume and Kant on causality

- Santayana from RB (xiii):

	> - Perspectives are essential to animal
	    apprehension; an observer, himself a part of the
	    world he observes, must have a particular
	    station in it; he cannot be equally near to
	    everything, nor internal to anything but
	    himself; of the rest he can only take views,
	    abstracted according to his sensibility and
	    foreshortened according to his interests.

- Related Santayana RB (xxx-xxxi)

	> - In an animal psyche as complex and as delicately
	    organized as the human, the spirit has a wider
	    basis and comes to light in more ways and in
	    more places than we might at first suspect. *And
	    at each point where it flowers at all, it
	    flowers into something original.* The ear yields
	    one unprecedented character to the sum of
	    existence in yielding sound, and the eye another
	    unprecedented element in yielding visual light
	    and colour. The same organic machinery, in other
	    places and motions, yields the unprecedented
	    elements of pleasure and pain and all the
	    emotions. Nor is the originality of the pigments
	    the whole originality in the spiritual picture.
	    Memory lights up perspectives which in nature
	    can subsist only as dead relations between dead
	    facts; and expectation, contradiction, doubts
	    and surprise vivify the mechanism of instinct
	    and turn plodding existence into a series of
	    comedies…. We should never become poets in the
	    end had we not been essentially poets from the
	    beginning. 

- Nietzsche on perspective?

- Basic conclusion: eyes need to be both absent yet present
  for seeing to be possible. “Openness” seems to indicate
  this dialectical predicament of absence and presence.
  Paradox of openness: being everything by being nothing;
  being something by being nothing else. 

- Santayana on necessity of being closed 

    > Page 642 RB: To be specific and exclusive is the
    condition for existing at all, for having a vocation,
    and for establishing an interest, even formal and
    unconscious, by which to distinguish life from death,
    benefit from injury.

- But note: Seeing things *as* they are: reduplication
  through "as" joins presence and absence of eyes.

- Eyes contain world insofar as they are invisible, but
  contained by the world insofar as they are visible.



# Part Three: Paradox resolved {#three}

[Back to top](#top)

## Revisiting of Parabola
- Parabola is infinitely open at end, leaving no room outside it. Perhaps the secret to openness.
- Openness and closedness integrated in containment or comprehension of everything
	- This in contrast to the hyperbola and its asymptotes
- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or even beyond. Containment allows this to happen somehow.

## From parabola to solution more generally:
- We are the beings who are open. (Heidegger on possibility.) 
- Being open to one thing means being open to everything, but cast this now in the form of containment rather than exposure.
- Possibly use Leibniz?
- Show solution in terms of perception and intellect.
	- Eyes present as if at a kind of circumference to the world, or field of vision, rather than within the world.
	- Perhaps we contain the world in openness as the boundary contains the circle This would also locate us in the middle, at the center of the circle.
		- Hjelmslev disc as the circle of comprehension? Does it illuminate boundary of circle?
	- Always at the center of our perceptual field
	- Openness locates what is open at a center of things in the world.
	- This goes hand in hand with sense in which we are not merely “nowhere” in seeing, nor “somewhere” within world as one among  many, but rather at the exact point in the world where we are alone. 
		- Schopenhauer quote on representation could go here.
		- Universality of consciousness/spirit: in Schopenhauer that one death means death of world
	- The same power that allows us to encompass the world also makes us individual, alone.
	- Integration of eyes missing and eyes present: being in the world ... alone.
	- The possibility of representation inverts the relation of self to world: the self is now, in a sense, responsible for the world. The world comes to be in wakefulness, and sin is found in the self. 
	- Related to sense in which we are visitors to world, and perhaps to how images are signs rather than substances.=
	- Logos in Aristotle: perception as a universality. Look at first lecture.
	- Openness is to a field, the "objects" are really relations. (Take music as an example).
	- Christian insight : spirit *sent* into the world. This makes spirit guiltless for the world, and deserving in sin for forgiveness 
	- Santayana RB p. 761:
		> - Spirit has been sent into the world by the very power by which the world was created; and it aspires to live, and to find a good and beautiful world to live in. etc. (Note that here S. says that apart from accidents spirit in us is identical with spirit everywhere, a divine witness, a divine sufferer, immortal, and only temporarily and involuntarily incarnate in a myriad distracted lives.
	- The given has an ideal character: this is how it can contain the world
	-  RB Santayana p. 633:
		> - Matter would never have evolved into animals, had not organization been potential in it from the beginning; and organization would never have awakened consciousness had not essence and truth overarched existence from all eternity, and summed it up, with all its perspectives ready, for spirit to perceive."


## Possible link to light
- Could openness finally be light?
- Try to incorporate necessity of light in the idea of eyes being open
- Light connecting absence and presence of eyes: allows us to see, but also to be seen
- Light connects the present eye and the absent eye.
- Power of sight and invisibility: Gyges in Herodotus
- Try to write account of why openness is somehow like light
	- Invisibility in openness like that of the burning wick, eclipsed by the glow it produces. Perhaps explains how eye disappears?
	- Open a curtain: suggests that openness has something to do with light

## Other thoughts to bring into lecture
- Basic form of extrinsicness, time, means existence, and sense of existence, is temporal.
- Not sure what I meant with above thought. Perhaps this is way to clarify division of inside from outside. Our sense of what lies outside us, as extrinsic, involves time. But our domain of awareness makes the extrinsic intrinsic, with a corresponding removal from the flux of time into an idea, or image, that is atemporal. Perhaps could spell this out.
- PS to Brendan message: my own thinking about this is centered on the following idea: existence is what makes otherwise purely intrinsic relations extrinsic. The difference between the painting of a landscape and the real landscape it's a painting of, for example, would be that in the painting, the relation of ground to sky is internal to the painting; there is an important sense in which the ground is not outside the sky (or vice versa) as elements of the painting. But in the real, or existing landscape, the ground *is* outside the sky. And this is what it means for it to be real or existing, and not just an image in a frame.
- Try to connect this to the field of perception as being unframed. Elements are outside one another. Perhaps this sense of extrinsicness is a sense of an infinite totality unbounded. A perspective does not have “sharp” boundaries. 
- Existence takes what would otherwise be intrinsic in relation and makes it extrinsic.
- Perhaps include discussion of "literacy" and liberal arts in discussion of perception. Perception as a way not of seeing the world, but of reading the world. Then move from symbolic in this sense to example in music, and Bach in particular. Perhaps this relates to idea of “things” in awareness as symbols.
- Look at Augustine 8.5

## Leftovers
- The word "open" also transcends grammar: verb (transitive and intransitive), adverb, adjective
	- He opened the door
	- The door opened slowly
	- The door is open
	- The open door distracted him
	- The door swung open

### Parabola:

Geometric example of being closed: a figure.

    - Euclid definition of figure: I.14: 

        > A figure is that which is contained by 
        any boundary or boundaries.

	- Note that "that which is contained" indicates an
	  inside or interior.

    - First example of figure in Euclid: circle

	> A circle is a plane figure contained by one line
	such that all the straight lines falling upon it
	from one point among those lying within the figure
	equal one another.

- Apollonian complication of figure:

    - A plane introduced into a cone produces conic sections.
    The circle is one, as is the ellipse. But the parabola
    and hyperbola are also produced, and they seem to be lines,
    strictly speaking, rather than figures.

* Imagine a parabola whose line continues, in either
direction, without end.

    - Is parabola a line or a figure? As a conic
    section the answer is ambiguous: the ellipse
    is closed, and hence a figure; but the cutting
    plane's continuous tilt eventually yields the
    parabola, the first open figure, which is thus
    a line.

    - Geometric terms already show an issue: figures
    are closed, so a parabola becomes a line, even
    though it is a figure.

- Image of openness but actually closed

- No way to go from outside to inside

- Openness a bridge between inside and outside, but how?

- Is the parabola really open? In the way the circle was?
  Push this paradox. How does one get from outside to inside
  the parabola?

- Perhaps use Apollonius Book II or Pascal as illustrations

	- In Pascal connection drawn between parabola and
	  a circle missing only a point. (Could this be used
	  later?)

	- Mathematical image of openness:

		- Circle with a point missing being an
		  ellipse, where the missing point becomes
		  an infinite expanse, transcending the
		  cone, produced by a "rotation" of the
		  cutting plane in a different direction, or
		  dimension, from the direction of the cone.

- Parabola: being open means being infinite. Being finite
  means being closed.

- Mathematical example of parabola: perhaps to get from
  outside to inside requires the movement of infinity or
  even beyond, but how is this possible?

covered his face, but, finally overpowered by the appetite,
he pushed his eyes wide open and rushed towards the corpses,
